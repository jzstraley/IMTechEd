            - Not interpretable for ischemia if:
                - Old LBBB, unable to reach target HR, or baseline ST elevation or on Digoxin
                - Get Stress Testing with Imaging (MPI, CMR, or Echo) if unable to do Exercise Stress Test
                    - Indications
                        - Unable to exercise
                        - Baseline EKG abnormalities limiting interpretation
                        - Indeterminate findings on Exercise Stress Test 
                    - No adenosine in asthmatics, hypotension (stimulate A2A receptors on vascular smooth muscles, magnified from rest)
            - Positive Findings (Findings associated with poor outcomes)
                - Poor exercise capacity (<5 METs)
                - Exercise-induced angina during minimal expenditure
                - Inability to achieve 85% age-predicted maximum HR with exercise
                - Fall in SBP below baseline during exercise
                - ST elevation
                - â‰¥ 2mm ST-depression during minimal expenditure
                - Early onset or prolonged duration of ST depression during testing
                - ST depression in multiple leads
                - Ventricular couplets or tachycardia during minimal expenditure or recovery
            - Balanced Ischemia
                - High risk features on Exercise testing
                - Coronary blood low is equally or nearly equally impaired
                - ST depression in multiple leads during peak stress but no evidence of ischemia on radionuclide MPI
