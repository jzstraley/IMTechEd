## Overview
- Description of consciousness: Lethargy, confusion, stupor, obtundation, coma 
- Both RAS and one cerebral cortex is required for normal consciousness
- Metabolic disorders > intoxications > anoxic brain damage
- Glasgow Coma Scale
- Posturing responses (subcortical):
    - Decerebrate: extension of all extremities
        - Uncal or tonsillar herniation
        - Worse than decorticate
    - Decorticate: flexion of upper limbs, extension of lower limbs
        - Upper motor neuron lesions
        - Anoxic/traumatic brain injury, stroke, ICH, tumor, enceophalopathy
- CBC, electrolytes, BUN/Cr, glucose, ABG, urinalysis, LFTs, ammonia, tox screen
    - CT/MRI/EEG, CSF tap

## General
- Testing
    - Cerebral Function (EEG)
    - Brainstem Function (Reflexes, corneal, cold water calories, doll’s eyes, spontaneous respirations)
    - Heart Function (ECG)
    - Motor Function (Physical)
- Normal: Aroused, Positive, Positive, Positive
- Locked In: Aroused, Positive, Positive, Negative
- Coma: Depressed, Positive, Positive, Positive
- Persistent Vegetative State: Absent, Positive, Positive, Positive
    - Lasts <3months, usually progresses one way or another within 2 weeks
    - Anoxic brain injury, Alzheimer’s, CJD
- Brain Death: Absent, Absent, Positive, Negative
    - Clinical
        - Lack of spontaneous respirations
        - CT Scan/MRI with devastating CNS event with known cause
        - Absence of confounding factors
        - No confirmed confounding drug intoxication or poisoning
        - Core temperature >36, SBP >100
    - Neurological
        - Comatose patient
        - Absent CN reflexes & motor responses (including flexor/extensor posturing)
        - Absent oculovestibular reflex (caloric response)
        - Absent cough with tracheal suctioning 
        - Absent sucking or rooting reflexes
        - Apnea by apnea test
            - Hemodynamically stable, temp >36, normal pH, normal PaCO2/PaO2
                - Pre-oxygenate with 100% oxygen for 10 minutes
                - Discontinue MV, continue 100% O2 passively for 10 minutes
                - Get ABG to confirm PaCO2 >60 or that it increased >20 from baseline ABG
            - Objectively confirms brainstem failure if pt cannot generate spontaneous breaths or trigger the vent in response to elevated PaCO2 levels >10 minutes after disabling control mode
            - Positive
                - Repeat clinical exam
                    - Suggestive of brain death: Brain dead
                    - Inconclusive or unreliable: Testing below
            - Inconclusive or unable to tolerate
                - Consider testing below
            - Negative
                - Not brain dead, no further testing
    - Further Testing if:
        - Unable to examine CN
        - Patients with neuromuscular paralysis or heavy sedation
        - Unable to complete apnea test or inconclusive results
        - Numerous confounding variables (multiorgan failure)
    - Other Testing
        - Cerebral Blood Flow Testing
            - Gold standard but highly invasive
