## Alzheimer Disease
o	MCC of dementia (65-80%), women more likely to get
	Most cases are not familial, but polygenic factors increase risk
	Increased incidence in Trisomy 21, Downs
	Cognitive > Psychiatric
o	Symptoms
	Insidious Onset
•	Gradual development of forgetfulness
•	Subacute decline
•	Typically diagnosed w/new behavioral problems and forgetting facts the patient previously remembered
	Early, insidious short-term memory loss
•	Early: General impairment in new memory formation and higher executive function. Decreased MMSE
•	Impairment in episodic memory (amnesia)
•	Language deficits and spatial disorientation
•	Frank dementia, aphasia, agnosia
•	Cannot encode new information, even with cues
•	Dysnomia (forgetting words)
•	Aphasia (diminished ability to produce language and spontaneous speech), apraxia (Inability to perform previously learned motor tasks), and agnosia (inability to recognize objects, persons, sounds, and shapes)
o	Cognitive decline characteristic of cerebral cortex
	Echolalia (dramatic repetition of every spoken phrase)
	Later, Personality changes 
	Lack gait abnormalities and urinary incontinence
•	Cortical rather than subcortical processing dysfunction
o	Diagnosis:
	MoCA 16-17 (97% sensitive)
	MRI: Gross atrophy in the mesotemporal lobe, as well as white matter lesions
•	Early: Mesial temporal lobe (hippocampus) is the first area affected
o	Diffuse Atrophy and sulci flattening, Ventricular Enlargement (third and lateral ventricles)
•	Loss of cholinergic neurons in basal forebrain, Degeneration of cholinergic neurons and degeneration in the hippocampus and cortex
•	Primarily parietal-occipital (non-amnestic form)
•	Decreased Ach activity, reduced brain choline acetyltransferase
•	NMDA overstimulation by glutamate leading to calcium influx and excitotoxicity
	FDG PET Scan: F-Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) used to detect amyloid plaques
•	May differentiated frontotemporal from Alzheimer disease
•	Get after MRI if needed
•	FDA approved, not covered by insurance
	Biopsy: Amyloid plaques deposited around the neuron and neurofibrillary tangles deposited inside the neuron
•	Beta amyloid plaques and Neurofibrillary tangles
o	Tangles are protein aggregates in neurons from tau hyperphosphorylation (correlate with disease severity best)
•	Neuritic plaques that stain silver, PAS (+)
o	Treatment
	Memory
•	1) Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors (centrally acting)
o	Tacrine
o	Donepezil (Aricept)
	Relative CI: SSS, LBBB, Uncontrolled Asthma, Angle-closure Glaucoma, Ulcer Disease (A SLUG)
o	Rivastigmine (Exelon), patch available
o	Galantamine (Razadyne)
	GI upset and bradycardia, orthostasis, N/V
•	+/- NMDA antagonist (moderate/severe)
o	Memantine (Namenda)
	Blocks glutamate induced excitotoxicity, slowing the decline
	Combination better than CI alone
•	Escalate doses every 4-6 weeks to minimize SEs
	Agitation
•	1) Nonpharmacologic Interventions
o	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23168825/ 
o	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25452601/ 
o	Behavioral and Environmental Therapy
•	Safety Risk or No response to Nonpharmacologic
o	Low-dose Antipsychotics
o	Antipsychotics increase mortality
	SSRIs, Trazadone may help

## Frontotemporal Dementia (FTD)
	AD inheritance in 20-40%
o	Symptoms
	Early onset <65 y/o usually (50s-60s), males > females
	Early Personality changes
•	Disinhibition > memory loss in early disease
•	Apathy, disinhibition, and compulsive behavior
•	Hoarding, hyperorality
	Tendency toward concrete thinking
	Progresses more rapidly, more significant personality and behavioral
	Absence of insight into their condition
o	Frontotemporal atrophy
	Spherical silver staining tau aggregates in neurons
•	Associated with TDP-43 and FUS
	Primarily affecting bilateral frontal and anterior temporal lobes
o	3 Subtypes:
	Behavioral Variant (bvFTD), Pick’s Disease
•	Atrophy of Frontal>Temporal Lobes
•	Accumulation of tau protein inclusions in hippocampi, temporal lobes and frontal lobes
•	Psychiatric > cognitive +/- motor
•	Compulsions, impulsions, gluttony
	Semantic Dementia (SD)
•	Primarily Dominant Temporal volume loss
•	Word Finding Difficulty
	Primary Progressive Non-Fluent Aphasia (PPA)
•	Primarily Dominant Temporal volume loss
•	Impaired Speech fluency with slower speech
o	All 3 subtypes lead to a combination dementia with:
	Personality changes, disinhibition, apathy, impaired social judgement
•	Dominant Frontal Lobe
	Verbal fluency problems
	Word-finding difficulty
•	Dominant Temporal Lobe
o	Treatment
	No good treatment
•	Increased risk of mortality of meds aimed at symptoms below
	SSRIs or trazodone for neuropsychic symptoms
•	Paroxetine 10mg daily to BID or Trazodone 25mg daily (Grade 2C)
	Atypical Antipsychotics last resort (High risk for EPS)
•	Quetiapine (12.5-25mg)
