## Vascular Cognitive Impairment
- Features
	Early gait impairment and personality/mood changes
	Slowed processing speed
- Imaging
	No hippocampal atropy and presence of confluent white matter hyperintensities on MRI of the brain

## Vascular Dementia (VaD)
- 10% of all dementia, >60 y/o
    - Higher risk in men and more likely to cause motor symptoms
- Primarily Executive/Cognitive Dysfunction
- Symptoms
	Stepwise (not gradual) decline w/focal neurological deficits
	Early Executive Dysfunction
o	2 Main Types:
	A) Multi-infarct Dementia
•	Abrupt onset, stepwise deterioration
•	Typically have prominent motor, reflex, visual, and gait abnormalities
•	Do not involve problems naming objects (Alzheimer’s)
•	More prominent fluctuation of cognition
	B) Binswanger Disease (Diffuse White Matter)
•	Associated with longstanding hypertension and/or atherosclerosis, diabetes
•	Diffuse subcortical white matter damage and subacute insidious course
•	Lacunar infarcts can be seen on MRI
•	Early: confusion, impaired memory, perception, executive functions
•	Late: difficulty in judgement and orientation
•	Apathy, anxiety, psychosis, euphoria, depression, aggression
•	Urinary incontinence and dysarthria with or without dysphagia, emotional lability
o	Cerebral infarction and/or deep white matter changes on imaging
	Multiple small cerebral infarctions from cardiovascular disorders
	No ventriculomegaly/generalized atrophy in early disease
- Treatment
    - Antihypertensives, anticoagulants

## Creutzfeldt-Jacob Disease (CJD)
o	Prion Disease
	sCJD (Sporadic): 95% of all, 55-65 y/o
	fCJD (Familial): 5% of all
	iCJD (iatrogenic) and vCJD (Variant), Younger patients
•	vCJD caused by mad cow disease
•	iCJD caused by infected human tissues or hormones
o	Symptoms
	Rapid progression of psychiatric symptoms with anxiety, fatigue, ataxia followed by dementia within weeks
	Akinetic Mutism
	Pyramidal/extrapyramidal dysfunction
	Cerebellar dysfunction, hiccups
	Hypokinesia, Startle Myoclonus late in disease course
	Circadian rhythm interruption
	Cerebellar ataxia, decreased tendon reflexes
o	Diagnosis: Real Time Quaking-Inducted Conversion Assay of CSF
•	Most sensitive and specific for prion proteins
o	Uses recombinant prion protein and thioflavin T, fluorescent dye
•	Elevated CSF of 14-3-3 regulatory proteins, total tau proteins
o	Not sensitive or specific enough
	Confirmatory: Brain Biopsy
	Generalized slowing with periodic, bi/tri phasic sharp wave complexes on EEG, “Triphasic Bursts”
	T1/T2 MRI: abnormal diffusion in thalmi, basal ganglia, or cortical ribbon
•	Increased intensity in the diffusion-weighted sequence in the BG and various cortical regions
o	Prognosis: fatal in <1 year in >90% of patients
o	Treatment
	None
•	Alcoholic Dementia
o	Ethanol Induced Dementia
	5-6 drinks a day needed over a lifetime
•	Hypoxic Encephalopathy
•	AIDS Dementia Complex
o	2% of all dementia, mcc in young patients
	Affects half of all AIDs patients not on ART
o	Cortical and subcortical atrophy and ventricular enlargement
	Subacute or chronic cognitive defects, depression, impaired psychomotor ability
	Irreversible dementia, subcortical symptoms, Basal ganglia or nigrostriatal dysfunction
	Slower movement, difficult smooth limb actions
	Related to the degree and duration of immunosuppression
o	HIV-Associated Neurocognitive Disorders (HAND)
	Dementia due to subcortical atrophy, inflammation and demyelination
•	Basal ganglia or nigrostriatal dysfunction 
•	Can be prevented in HIV but not AIDS
	RF: Long standing HIV, Age ≥50, CD4 < 200
	Severity (increasing as you go down):
•	Asymptomatic neurocognitive impairment
•	Mild neurocognitive disorder
•	HIV-associated Dementia/Encephalopathy
	Symptoms
•	Impaired memory and attention/concentration, anhedonia
o	Personality and behavior changes
•	Decreased alertness, confusion, blunted affect, slowed movement, impaired concentration, generalized atrophy
•	Movement disorders later (tremor and gait)
o	Slower movements with substantial cognitive impairment late
	Prognosis: Quicker progression, months, life expectancy <1 year
	Diagnosis: Clinical, neuropsychological testing
•	MRI: diffuse increase in white matter intensity
o	Diffuse atrophy later
	Treatment
•	ART with high CNS uptake
•	Cortico-Basal Syndrome
o	Asymmetric posterior frontoparietal degeneration

## Traumatic Encephalopathy Syndrome (TES)
- Progressive neurodegenerative syndrome with repetitive head trauma
- Emotional dysregulation, behavior change, motor disturbance w/parkinsonian features
    - Memory features largely lacking
- Generalized cerebral atrophy, MRI may be normal
