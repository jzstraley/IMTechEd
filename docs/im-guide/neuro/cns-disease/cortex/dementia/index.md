## General
- Mini Mental Status Exam (MMSE)
    - Used to determine dementia/delirium
    - Orientation (time, place) – 10 points
    - Registration (repeating 3 objects) – 3 points
    - Attention and calculation (serial 7s, world backwards) – 1 point each
    - Recall (recall 3 objects)
    - Language (naming objects, 3 step command)
    - Spatial (copy a design, clock)
    - Shorter than MoCA
- Altered Mental Status
    - Reitan Trail Test (timed connect the numbers test)
        - Abnormal indicates AMS
        - Useful for detecting subtle mental status changes
- Normal Aging
    - 1) Memory Loss
        - Can provide details about incidents of forgetfulness
        - Patient is concerned about memory loss
        - Recent conversations and important events memory is intact
    - 2) Word Finding
        - Occasional (expressive aphasia)
        - No receptive aphasia
    - 3) Independence and Functioning
        - Maintains ADLs
        - Able to operate common appliances w/normal social skills
        - Does not get lost in familiar territory (may have to pause to reorient)
            - More important than MoCA for screening
    - Slight decrease in fluid intelligence (Ability to process new information quickly)
    - Normal functioning, No dependence on others for activities of daily living
    - MoCA score ≥26/30

## Mild Cognitive Impairment (MCI)
- [Mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia: a clinical perspective](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25282431/){:target="_blank"}
- Mild decline in ≥1 domain 
- Normal functioning in all ADLs with compensation
    - Complex attention, learning and memory, language, executive function
    - Can manage finances
    - Remember names by writing them down
- Types:
    - Amnestic MCI
        - More common (2x), general cognition is intact
        - More likely to degenerate to Alzheimer disease
            - [Is Mild Cognitive Impairment a Precursor of Alzheimer's Disease? Short Review](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26841152/){:target="_blank"}
    - Non-amnestic MCI
- MoCA score <26/30 (average 22-23)
- 5-10% progress to dementia per year, 10-20% progress to Alzheimer Disease
- [Prevalence of DSM-5 Mild Neurocognitive Disorder in Dementia-Free Older Adults: Results of the Population-Based LIFE-Adult-Study](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27618647/){:target="_blank"}
- Prevention
    - Physical Exercise

## Dementia (Major Neurocognitive Disorder)
- [The initial recognition and diagnosis of dementia](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9617846/){:target="_blank"}
- Persistent deterioration of cognitive function with little or no disturbance of conscious or perception
- Prevention:
    - Controlling vascular RF, dietary modifications, exercise
- Symptoms
    - Significant decline in >1 domain (Memory, Executive, Perception, Language, Behavior), progressive and interfere with daily functioning
        - Worsen in a subacute fashion over a period of months to years
        - Irreversible global impairment
        - Impaired daily functioning, needing help with ADLs
    - MMSE <24 is 87% sensitive and 82% specific for dementia
        - May have normal MMSE/MOCA if highly educated
            - ≥9 years of education: Median MMSE 29
    - [Detecting dementia with the mini-mental state examination in highly educated individuals](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18625866/){:target="_blank"}
        - 5-8 years of education: Median 26
    - 1) Memory Loss
        - Cannot remember specific instances of forgetfulness
        - Family>patient concern
        - Notable decline in memory for recent important events
            - Get lost for hours in familiar territory
            - “Sundowning” increased confusion at night
        - Confabulation and unaware of problem
            - “feels like performance was acceptable, questions worded wrong”
    - 2) Word Finding
        - Frequent, with substitutions
        - Some receptive aphasia
    - 3) Independence
        - Dependent for ADLs
        - Unable to operate, loses interest in social activities
        - Can get lost for hours in familiar territory while driving/walking
- W/U: CBC, B12, TSH
    - MRI w/o Contrast > CT w/o contrast for dementia with <3 years since onset
- Treatment
    - Dementia + MVA: Restrict Driving

## Pseudodementia (Depression-related cognitive impairment)
- Reversible mild-moderate cognitive impairment (<26/30)
    - 8% of all dementia
- Symptoms
    - Acute onset (often after physical illness or loss of loved one)
    - Features of Depression (mood, interest, energy) at onset
        - Poor Concentration (little effort in remembering)
    - Acute onset, then episodic over weeks to months 
    - Patient aware of cognitive decline, “I don’t know”
    - More likely to have “physical slowing”
- Treatment
    - SSRIs, ECT, Psychotherapy

## Gerstmann Syndrome
- Stroke or traumatic brain injury usually
- Dominant parietal injuries
- Agraphia, acalculia, finger agnosia, left-right disorientation
