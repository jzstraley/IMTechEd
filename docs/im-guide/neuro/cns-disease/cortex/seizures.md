## General
- Classified as Partial or Generalized
    - Partial (Question is consciousness impaired?)
        - Complex Partial Seizure
        - Simple Partial Seizure
    - Generalized (Question are they convulsive?)
        - Tonic-Clonic or Myoclonic Seizures
        - Absence Seizures
    - Provoked: 2/2 alcohol, medication, medication withdrawal, mass
- W/U:
    - MRI > CT as well
    - Electroencephalogram (EEG) for a patient with first time seizures
        - EEG used to risk stratify normal brain-imaging pts
        - Continues EEG for nonconvulsive seizures
- 1st Seizure
    - Risk of recurrence after a first unprovoked seizure
        - [Risk of recurrence 40-50% generally within 2 years](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18184149/){:target="_blank"}
    - Abnormal MRI or EEG after single seizure indicates a high risk of future recurrent seizures
        - Benefit seen with antiepileptic drugs (decreases risk to 20-25%)
    - Normal MRI/EEG
        - May not need antiepileptics
    - [Considerations in the treatment of a first unprovoked seizure](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18777475/){:target="_blank"}
- 1st Seizure + Status Epilepticus or multiple: Recurrence 60%: Antiepileptics
    - Treat ≥1 provoked or ≥2 unprovoked seizures >24hrs apart with Antiepileptics
    - May try to wean after 2 years on antiepileptics and no seizures

## Psychogenic Nonepileptic Seizures (PNES)
- Conversion disorder, not true seizure
    - 20% also have epilepsy
- Symptoms
    - Forceful eye closure, side to side body movements, rapid alerting and reorienting, memory recall of seizure
    - NOT associated with abnormal cortical activity, lack post-ictal confusion
    - Intact reflexes, pelvic thrusts
    - Side to side head movements
- Diagnosis: Video electroencephalogram gold standard, Psychiatric Assessment
    - Lack of epileptiform activity (normal EEG)
    - Prolactin normal 15-30 minutes after seizure (elevated in epileptic seizure)

## Generalized Tonic-Clonic Seizure (GTCS)
- Abrupt loss of consciousness, stiffening of the muscles, rhythmic jerking of extremities, open eyes during ictus
- Most fall asleep immediately after seizure and have postictal confusion on awakening
    - 1) Valproic Acid
        - Anticonvulsant which limits the rapid firing of neurons by inhibiting voltage gated sodium channels
- Treatment
    - Preventative
        - Carbamazepine, Phenytoin
    - Abortive?
        - 1) IV Lorazepam (Benzo)
        - 2) Phenytoin/Fosphenytoin (less respiratory depression)
        - 3) Propofol + Midazolam
        - 4) Phenobarbital

## Myoclonic Seizure
- Myoclonic may have twitching of the arms and legs, but usually bilateral and <1s
- May result in dropping objects
- Awareness maintained

## Generalized Absence Seizures
- Short period of profound impairment with intact body tone
- Last <15s typically, occur multiple times per day
- No associated postictal focal weakness or confusion
- 2/3 outgrow
- Non-convulsive
- Consciousness lost
- Diagnosis: 3-Hz per-second spike and wave pattern on EEG
- Treatment
    - Ethosuximide and valproic acid

## Focal Aware Seizure (Simple Partial Seizure)
- Consciousness is preserved by definition
- Jacksonian Seizures: Involve motor strip
- Treatment
    - Gabapentin
    - Phenytoin and Carbamazepine

## Focal Seizure with Diminished Consciousness (Complex Partial Seizure)
- Aka Focal Impaired Awareness Seizures, Focal Dyscognitive Seizure
- Consciousness Impairment with postictal confusion
- Features
    - Sudden onset of staring or arrest speech (seizure-related aphasia) or behavior lasting 30-90s
    - Pt unaware and unresponsive
    - Postictal confusion or somnolence
    - May see twitching or stiffness during, transient weakness afterwards
    - Weekly to monthly
- Treatment
    - Levetiracetam or Lamotrigine if reproductive age
    - Phenytoin
    - Carbamazepine
        - Inhibits activation of voltage gated sodium channels

## Generalized Epilepsy
- Definition: 2 seizures more than 24 hours apart w/o provoking factors
- RF: Stroke, dementia
- Treatment
    - Partial Seizures: Phenytoin and Carbamazepine
    - Tonic-clonic Seizures: Phenytoin and Carbamazepine
    - Absence Seizures: Ethosuximide and Valproic Acid
    - Old w/2 clearly documented unprovoked seizures: 
        - Lamotrigine, Gabapentin, or Levetiracetam
        - Lamotrigine rash: Gabapentin

## Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME)
- MC form of idiopathic generalized epilepsy
- Onset typically in teens/twenties
- Associated with triggers: sleep deprivation, alcohol use, stress
- Features
    - “dropping items” especially in the morning
    - Generalized tonic-clonic seizures, 30% have absence seziures
- Diagnosis:
    - Myoclonic Seizures
- Treatment
    - Lifelong AED
    - Levetiracetam
        - Safe in pregnancy
    - Valproic Acid
        - Associated with weight gain, PCOS, teratogenic
    - Lamotrigine
        - May worsen myoclonic seizures in some patients, not preferred
        - Safe in pregnancy
    - Topiramate
        - Teratogenic, good for comorbid migraines

## Nonconvulsive Status Epilepticus
- Suspect in critically ill pts who have AMS w/o clear cause
- Symptoms
    - Coming off propofol and not waking up w/twitching
- Diagnosis: Continuous EEG for 24 hours

## Convulsive Status Epilepticus (CSE)
- GTCS for > 5 minutes or two GTCS within 5 minutes of each other without regaining consciousness or return to mental baseline
- Treatment
    - A) Intubation +/- Thiamine + IV glucose
    - B) Meds
        - 1) Lorazepam 0.1mg/kg IV up to max of 8mg
- Diazepam rectally or IV 10mg q5min prn to max of 30mg
- IM Midazolam 10mg if no IV
        - 2) IV Fosphenytoin > Phenytoin (Less likely to cause hypotension or bradycardia) alternatives are IV Valproic Acid or Levetiracetam
- Levetiracetam 60mg/kg (up to 4500mg) IV over 10 minutes, >75kg = 4500mg.
        - 3) Phenobarbital (SE: respiratory depression)
        - 4) Propofol w/intubation

## Todd’s Paralysis
- Transient unilateral weakness following a tonic-clonic seizure that usually spontaneously resolves
