## Trauma
* Depressed skull fracture, severely displaced/angulated fracture, open fracture, femoral neck/intertrochanteric fracture
    * Take straight to the Operating Room
    * More Angulation after fractures in a child will not lead to permanent deformity
* LOC: CT w/o Contrast
* Linear skull fractures
    * Closed: Leave alone
    * Open: Close
    * Comminuted or depressed: Operating room
* Midface Fractures
    * Le Fort I – maxilla at the nasal fossa
        * Unstable maxilla
        * Diagnosis: CT
    * Le Fort II – maxilla, nasal bones, medial orbits
        * Unstable maxilla + Nasal Bone mobility
        * Incorrect teeth placement
        * Diagnosis: CT of the face
        * Management
            * ENT Consultation
    * Le Fort III – maxilla, zygoma, nasal bones +/- cranial bones
        * Airway often compromised
        * “floating” maxilla/face from the rest of the head
    * Orbital Blowout Fracture
        * Limited upward gaze, swelling and ecchymosis infraorbitally
        * Fracture of superior portion of maxillary sinus
        * Diagnosis: CT
    * Zygomaticomaxillary-Orbital Complex Fractures
        * “tripod” fractures
    * Zygomatic-frontal and temporal sutures and orbital floor
        * MVA or Assult
        * Facial flattening, CN V palsy, Trismus, diplopia
        * Diagnosis: CT
        * Treatment
            * Surgical Repair

## Intercranial Pressure (ICP)
* Normal <15 mmHg, maintain ICP <20 and cerebral perfusion pressure >60
    * ICP to monitor CPP
    * CPP = MAP – ICP
        * Arterial line required for MAP
    * Increased ICP + Hyponatremia: SAH
    * Increased ICP
        * Headache, Nausea, Vomiting, AMS
        * Cushing’s Reflex
            * Late stage indicator
    * Headaches (worse at night), Nausea/vomiting and AMS
    * +/- focal neurologic symptoms, and seizure
    * Valsalva, leaning forward, cough make it worse
        * Worrisome finding suggestive of brainstem compression
            * Hypertension, bradycardia, respiratory depression
        * Brain Tumors, trauma, cerebral edema, hemorrhage, hydrocephalus, hepatic encephalopathy, impaired venous outflow
        * Treatment
            * Emergent treatment if GCS ≤8 + Cushing’s reflex
                * Elevation of the bed (increase venous flow)
                * Sedation (control hypertension, decrease demand)
                * Hyperventilation (decrease CO2, cerebral vasoconstriction)
                    * pCO2 to 26-30 is goal
            * IV Mannitol (draws fluid from tissues)
            * CSF Removal (Hyrdrocephalus)
            * Lidocaine if intubation is needed
