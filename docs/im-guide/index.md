- Welcome to my guide for internal medicine. Please see the disclaimer above.
- As a cardiology fellow, you will likely sense a **hint** of favoritism, but I've tried to include as much information as I've learn to make this as useful as possible for each level of training.
- Feel free to suggest edits via Github. Most pages will have the ability to edit in the top right corner of the inner page text.
  - These will require an approval process *please be patient*
  - For topic suggestions, please email me at mailto:imteched@gmail.com
