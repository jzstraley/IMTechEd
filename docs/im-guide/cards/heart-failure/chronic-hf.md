## General

- Chronic Heart Failure can be classified multiple ways, most commonly by Ejection Fraction
    - **Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction (HFpEF)**
        - HFpEF is the most common cause of Chronic Heart Failure
            - 50% of patients hospitalized with CHF
                - Exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, lower extremity edema, but normal or near normal LVEF with objective evidence of diastolic dysfunction (abnormal LV filling pressures) by echo
        - LV diastolic dysfunction due to impaired relaxation w/EF >50%
        - Impaired Diastolic Filling, Decreased compliance
            - [The pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction][19]
        - Decrease in SV and Increase in EDP
        - Significantly Increased LVEDP associated with Decrease in LVEDV
            - Increased afterload, increased LV thickness, decreased LV size, decreased Compliance – Decrease in Ventricular distensibility that impairs ventricular filling during diastole (EF ≥50)
            - Decreased LV Compliance, Decreased Lusitropy
        - Normal CO w/ increased LVEDV/RVEDP, tachycardia, S4
            - Increased venous hydrostatic pressure
            - Recurrent pulmonary flash edema
            - 2/2 hypertensive cardiac remodeling (LVH) with left atrial dilation, orthopnea, and elevated BNP
                - Mcly due to myocardial hypertrophy
                - RF: Chronic hypertension (concentric LVH), Obesity & sedentary lifestyle (myocardial interstitial fibrosis), CAD & related RF (T2DM)
        - Commonly due to
            - Pericardial Tamponade, Constrictive Pericarditis, Restrictive or Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathies
        - 1) Hypertension w/Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (90%)
            - Chronic Hypertension (Concentric LV Hypertrophy)
            - Primary (HCM), Secondary (Hypertension), Age, Fibrosis
            - LVH shows Severe dip in V1 and rise in V6
        - 2) Restrictive Cardiomyopathy (<9%)
            - Amyloid/Sarcoid, Hemochromatosis
            - Obesity/Sedentary lifestyle (myocardial interstitial fibrosis)
            - Preserved systolic dysfunction, bi-atrial dilation, pulmonary hypertension in a pt with refractory HF
            - Kussmaul’s sign
                - Lack of typical inspiratory decline in CVP
                - Associated with an S3
        - Treatment
            - Eval for Transplant w/Advanced HF specialist
    - **Heart Failure with Reduced Ejection Fraction (HFrEF)**
        - 1) Ischemic Heart Disease/Cardiomyopathy (Impaired Contractility)
            - IHD/CAD = 60-75% of HF cases in developing world
                - Decreased cardiac output due to impaired contractility
                - A compensatory rise in NE, Renin, and ADH
                - Increases SVR
            - Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)
            - Chronic Volume Overload (MR, AR, Shunting)
            - Chronic Lung Disease (Cor pulmonale, Pulmonary vascular disorders)
        - 2) Dilated Cardiomyopathies (Impaired Contractility)
            - 30%, Defect in force generation, transmission, myocyte signaling
                - Genetic (20-50%) (Cytoskeleton mutation)
                - Non-Genetic (Myocarditis, Peri-partum, Toxic (alcohol), Idiopathic)
                - Infiltrative Disorders
        - 3) Valvular Heart Disease
            - 15%
            - Toxic/drug-induced damage (Metabolic disorder, Viral)
            - Chagas disease
            - Rate and Rhythm disorders (Chronic Arrythmias)
        - 4) Hypertension
            - 10%
        - 80% die from Cardiovascular Causes (MC Cause of death)
            - Worsening HF (Cardiogenic Shock, Low Output State)
            - 40% Sudden Cardiac Death (VTach (most common), Bradyarrhythmia)
        - Hypertension contributes to 75% of patients, also DM
        - Valvular heart disease also contributes (EtOH, Hypertension, Drugs)
            - Systolic Heart Failure (Contractile Failure)
        - Compliance (C) = EDV/EDP
            - EDV not easily measured, thus use EF = SV/EDV measured via TTE
        - Characterized by decreased CO/CI, increased SVR, and increased LVEDV
        - Decreased CO (insufficient ventricular contractility, EF will be low)
        - Decrease in SV and Increase in EDP
            - Decreased CO, increases A-a O2 and decreases renal perfusion
        - Increased EDP associated with Increase in EDV
            - Decreased Compliance (EF ≤40%), Increased HR
    - **Heart Failure with Improved Ejection Fraction (HFimpEF)**

## Diagnosis

- [A Simple, Evidence-Based Approach to Help Guide Diagnosis of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction][20]
- H2pEF risk score
    - Assesses likelihood of HFpEF and is used to discriminate cardiac vs. non-cardiac causes of dyspnea
    - Obesity (2 points), Afib (3 points), age >60 (1 point), 2 Antihypertensives (1 point), Echo E/e’ ratio >9 (1 point) and Echo PAS pressure >35 (1 point)
- Echo
    - Normal LV cavity size, increased LV wall thickness, LAE, abnormal diastolic function, elevated PAS pressure >35
- BNP may be normal in obese or only exertional symptoms
