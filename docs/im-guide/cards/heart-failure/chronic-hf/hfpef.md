## General

* 50% of HF cases

## Physiology

* LV diastolic dysfunction due to impaired relaxation w/EF >50%
* Impaired Diastolic Filling, Decreased compliance
    * [The pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction][1]
* Decrease in SV and Increase in EDP
* Significantly Increased LVEDP associated with Decrease in LVEDV
    * Increased afterload, increased LV thickness, decreased LV size, decreased Compliance – Decrease in Ventricular distensibility that impairs ventricular filling during diastole (EF ≥50)
    * Decreased LV Compliance, Decreased Lusitropy
* Normal CO w/ increased LVEDV/RVEDP, tachycardia, S4
    * Increased venous hydrostatic pressure
    * Recurrent pulmonary flash edema
    * 2/2 hypertensive cardiac remodeling (LVH) with left atrial dilation, orthopnea, and elevated BNP
        * Mcly due to myocardial hypertrophy
        * RF: Chronic hypertension (concentric LVH), Obesity & sedentary lifestyle (myocardial interstitial fibrosis), CAD & related RF (T2DM)
* Commonly due to
    * Pericardial Tamponade, Constrictive Pericarditis, Restrictive or Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathies
* 1) Hypertension w/Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (90%)
    * Chronic Hypertension (Concentric LV Hypertrophy)
    * Primary (HCM), Secondary (Hypertension), Age, Fibrosis
    * LVH shows Severe dip in V1 and rise in V6
* 2) Restrictive Cardiomyopathy (<9%)
    * Amyloid/Sarcoid, Hemochromatosis
    * Obesity/Sedentary lifestyle (myocardial interstitial fibrosis)
    * Preserved systolic dysfunction, bi-atrial dilation, pulmonary hypertension in a pt with refractory HF
    * Kussmaul’s sign
        * Lack of typical inspiratory decline in CVP
        * Associated with an S3

## Mortality

* Due to progressive HF and arrhythmias
* 5-year rate of 36%
* 10-year rate of 63%
    * Treatment
        * Eval for Transplant w/Advanced HF specialist

## Symptoms

* Exertional dyspnea
* Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
* Orthopnea

## Exam

* S3
* Elevated CVP
* Crackles
* Peripheral Edema

## Diagnosis

* [A Simple, Evidence-Based Approach to Help Guide Diagnosis of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction][2]
* H2pEF risk score
    * Assesses likelihood of HFpEF and is used to discriminate cardiac vs. non-cardiac causes of dyspnea
    * Obesity (2 points), Afib (3 points), age >60 (1 point), 2 Antihypertensives (1 point), Echo E/e’ ratio >9 (1 point) and Echo PAS pressure >35 (1 point)
* Echo
    * Normal LV cavity size, increased LV wall thickness, LAE, abnormal diastolic function, elevated PAS pressure >35
* BNP may be normal in obese or only exertional symptoms

## Prognosis

* Cause of Death (broader than HFrEF):
    * Cardiovascular
        * Worsening HF (RHF, Restrictive cardiomyopathy)
        * Sudden Death (Non-arrhythmic, Tachycardia, Bradycardia)
        * Myocardial Infarction
        * Vascular (Aortic Aneurysm, PE)
        * Cerebrovascular (Intracranial hemorrhage, Stroke)
    * Non-Cardiovascular
        * Renal (ESRD, renal venous congestion)
        * Resp (Failure, pulmonary hypertension, COPD)
        * Infection/sepsis
    * Multisystem (Organ failure)

## Management

* Diuresis
    * Caution in diastolic HF w/diuretics
* Afterload reduction as needed
    * Reduce hospitalization
        * MRAs and SGLT-2s
    * ACEI/ARB = no mortality benefit
* BP control
* Treat exacerbating conditions (CAD, OSA, Afib)
* Exercise training/cardiac rehabilitation
    * Improves functional capacity and overall quality of life
