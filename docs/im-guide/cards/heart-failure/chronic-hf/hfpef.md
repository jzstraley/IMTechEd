## General
o	50% of HF cases

##	Physiology
o	LV diastolic dysfunction due to impaired relaxation w/EF >50%
o	Impaired Diastolic Filling, Decreased compliance
	The pathophysiology of heart failure with preserved ejection fraction
•	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24958077/ 
o	Decrease in SV and Increase in EDP
o	Significantly Increased LVEDP associated with Decrease in LVEDV
	Increased afterload, increased LV thickness, decreased LV size, decreased Compliance – Decrease in Ventricular distensibility that impairs ventricular filling during diastole (EF ≥50)
	Decreased LV Compliance, Decreased Lusitropy
o	Normal CO w/ increased LVEDV/RVEDP, tachycardia, S4
	Increased venous hydrostatic pressure
	Recurrent pulmonary flash edema
	2/2 hypertensive cardiac remodeling (LVH) with left atrial dilation, orthopnea, and elevated BNP
•	Mcly due to myocardial hypertrophy
•	RF: Chronic hypertension (concentric LVH), Obesity & sedentary lifestyle (myocardial interstitial fibrosis), CAD & related RF (T2DM)
o	Commonly due to
	Pericardial Tamponade, Constrictive Pericarditis, Restrictive or Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathies
o	1) Hypertension w/Left Ventricular Hypertrophy (90%)
	Chronic Hypertension (Concentric LV Hypertrophy)
	Primary (HCM), Secondary (Hypertension), Age, Fibrosis
	LVH shows Severe dip in V1 and rise in V6
o	2) Restrictive Cardiomyopathy (<9%)
	Amyloid/Sarcoid, Hemochromatosis
	Obesity/Sedentary lifestyle (myocardial interstitial fibrosis)
	Preserved systolic dysfunction, bi-atrial dilation, pulmonary hypertension in a pt with refractory HF
	Kussmaul’s sign
•	Lack of typical inspiratory decline in CVP
•	Associated with an S3

## Mortality
•	Due to progressive HF and arrythmias
•	5-year rate of 36%
•	10-year rate of 63%

- Treatment
•	Eval for Transplant w/Advanced HF specialist
## Symptoms
o	Exertional dyspnea
o	Paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea
o	Orthopnea

## Exam
o	S3
o	Elevated CVP
o	Crackles
o	Peripheral Edema

## Diagnosis
o	A Simple, Evidence-Based Approach to Help Guide Diagnosis of Heart Failure With Preserved Ejection Fraction
	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29792299/ 
o	H2pEF risk score 
	Assesses likelihood of HFpEF and is used to discriminate cardiac vs. noncardiac causes of dyspnea
	Obesity (2 points), Afib (3 points), age >60 (1 point), 2 Antihypertensives (1 point), Echo E/e’ ratio >9 (1 point) and Echo PAS pressure >35 (1 point)
o	Echo
	Normal LV cavity size, increased LV wall thickness, LAE, abnormal diastolic function, elevated PAS pressure >35
o	BNP may be normal in obese or only exertional symptoms

## Prognosis
o	Cause of Death (broader than HFrEF):
	Cardiovascular
•	Worsening HF (RHF, Restrictive cardiomyopathy)
•	Sudden Death (Non-arrhythmic, Tachy, Brady)
•	Myocardial Infarction
•	Vascular (Aortic Aneurysm, PE)
•	Cerebrovascular (Intracranial hemorrhage, Stroke)
	Non-Cardiovascular
•	Renal (ESRD, renal venous congestion)
•	Resp (Failure, pulmonary hypertension, COPD)
•	Infection/sepsis
	Multisystem (Organ failure)

## Management
o	Diuresis
	Caution in diastolic HF w/diuretics
o	Afterload reduction as needed
	Reduce hospitalization
•	MRAs and SGLT2s
	ACEI/ARB = no mortality benefit
o	BP control
o	Treat exacerbating conditions (CAD, OSA, Afib)
o	Exercise training/cardiac rehabilitation
	Improves functional capacity and overall quality of life
