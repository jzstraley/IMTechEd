## Etiology
- 1) Ischemic Heart Disease/Cardiomyopathy (Impaired Contractility)
    - IHD/CAD = 60-75% of HF cases in developing world
        - Decreased cardiac output due to impaired contractility
        - A compensatory rise in NE, Renin, and ADH
        - Increases SVR
    - Coronary Artery Disease (CAD)
    - Chronic Volume Overload (MR, AR, Shunting)
    - Chronic Lung Disease (Cor pulmonale, Pulmonary vascular disorders)
- 2) Dilated Cardiomyopathies (Impaired Contractility)
    - 30%, Defect in force generation, transmission, myocyte signaling
        - Genetic (20-50%) (Cytoskeleton mutation)
        - Non-Genetic (Myocarditis, Peri-partum, Toxic (alcohol), Idiopathic)
        - Infiltrative Disorders 
- 3) Valvular Heart Disease
    - 15%
    - Toxic/drug-induced damage (Metabolic disorder, Viral)
    - Chagas disease
    - Rate and Rhythm disorders (Chronic Arrythmias)
- 4) Hypertension
    - 10%

## General
- 80% die from Cardiovascular Causes (MC Cause of death)
    - Worsening HF (Cardiogenic Shock, Low Output State)
    - 40% Sudden Cardiac Death (VTach (most common), Bradyarrhythmia)
- Hypertension contributes to 75% of patients, also DM
- Valvular heart disease also contributes (EtOH, Hypertension, Drugs)
        - Systolic Heart Failure (Contractile Failure)
- Compliance (C) = EDV/EDP
    - EDV not easily measured, thus use EF = SV/EDV measured via TTE
- Characterized by decreased CO/CI, increased SVR, and increased LVEDV
- Decreased CO (insufficient ventricular contractility, EF will be low)
- Decrease in SV and Increase in EDP
    - Decreased CO, increases A-a O2 and decreases renal perfusion
- Increased EDP associated with Increase in EDV
    - Decreased Compliance (EF ≤40%), Increased HR

## Poor Prognostic Factors for HFrEF
- 30-40% die within 1 year of diagnosis and 60-70% die within 5 years
- Higher NYHA functional Class
- Exam
    - Resting Tachycardia
    - Presence of an S3 gallop
    - Elevated JVP
    - Hypotension: BP <100/60
- Labs: 
    - Hyponatremia
    - Elevated pro-BNP levels, high NE and catecholamines, elevated troponins
    - Renal insufficiency
    - Low maximal oxygen consumption (peak VO2)
- ECG: QRS >120ms, LBBB pattern
- Echocardiography
    - Moderate to severe mitral regurgitation
    - Severe LV dysfunction
    - Concomitant diastolic dysfunction
    - Reduced RV function
    - Pulmonary Hypertension
- Other: 
    - Anemia
    - Atrial Fibrillation
    - Diabetes Mellitus
