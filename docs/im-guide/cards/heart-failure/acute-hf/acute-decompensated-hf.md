## Causes

- 80-85% are Chronic HF exacerbations due to:
    - Noncompliance, uncontrolled hypertension, rapid Afib
- 15-20% are new onset Acute Coronary Syndrome (ACS)
    - +/- MI, arrhythmias, Acute severe MR/AR
- <1% but Increasing Incidence
    - Stress-Induced Cardiomyopathy
        - Catecholamine Excess
        - Post-menopausal women w/emotional stress, SAH, TBI
        - Dyspnea and chest pain +/- ST changes, T wave inversion
        - Ballooning or hypokinesis of LV apex
        - May be unstable but resolves in days to weeks
        - Dobutamine is CI
    - Low-Output Heart Failure
        - Decompensated heart failure resulting from left ventricular dysfunction
        - Increased afterload and preload with decreased CO
- HFpEF is the most common cause
    - 50% of patients hospitalized with CHF
    - Exertional dyspnea, orthopnea, lower extremity edema, but normal or near normal LVEF with objective evidence of diastolic dysfunction (abnormal LV filling pressures) by echo

## Labs

- ABG shows hypoxia, hypocapnia, and respiratory alkalosis
    - Less specific than proBNP and PCWP
    - Respiratory alkalosis (hyperventilation) often seen in contrast with COPD which has respiratory acidosis
- Elevated BNP has high sensitivity for AHFD, BNP > 100 is indicative

## Management

- 4 Main Arms of Management:
    - 1) Typical
        - High-Risk Features: Renal insufficiency, Biomarkers of injury, ACS, Arrythmias, hypoxia, PE, infection
        - Hypertensive: Vasodilators
        - Normotensive: Diuretics
    - 2) Pulmonary Edema
        - Severe Pulmonary congestion with hypoxia
        - High-Risk Features: New onset arrhythmia, valvular disease, myocardial ischemia, CNS injury, Drug toxicity
        - Hypertensive: Vasodilators
        - Normotensive: Diuretics, O2, NIPPV
    - 3) Low Output
        - Hypoperfusion w/ End organ damage
        - High-Risk Features: Low pulse pressure, cool extremities, cardiorenal syndrome, hepatic congestion
        - Hypertensive: Vasodilators
        - Normotensive: Inotropic Therapy
    - 4) [Cardiogenic Shock][1]
        - Hypotension, low cardiac output, and end organ failure
        - High-Risk Features: Extreme distress, pulmonary congestion, Renal failure
        - Inotropic Therapy/Mechanical Circulatory Support
- Avoid BB in patients with Decompensated CHF or Bradycardia (Pulmonary edema will worsen, and slow down the HR)
    - Decrease by 50% if unresponsive to diuresis or discontinue BB
        - Daily electrolytes and CR/BUN
        - +/- Thiazide
- Consider IV Vasodilators (Nitroglycerin, Nitroprusside)
    - Relieves dyspnea and tachycardia due to pulmonary edema
    - High BP (25%): Nitroglycerin or nitroprusside
        - Glycerin is safer, prusside (CN and Thiocyanate toxicity, Coronary steal syndrome in ACS)
        - Avoid Nitroprusside in renal failure
        - Nitro Tolerance after 24h possible
    - Normal BP (50%): Nitroglycerin or Nesiritide
        - Nesiritide, recombinant BNP (diuresis + vasodilators)
            - Binds heparin (not through same tube)
    - Vasodilator intolerance (hypotension, decreased urine output), mcc is pulmonary edema
        - Inodilators: Positive inotropic, vasodilators
            - Dobutamine (5ng up to 20), Milrinone (50ng, then up to 1.13, renally dosed), Levosimendan (12ng)
- Diuretic Therapy
    - Initial dose 1 to 2.5 times home dose, increase by 50-100% if unresponsive at 2-6 hours
        - Furosemide IV bolus at 40mg if normal kidneys, double if not enough after 2 hours, then give BID if adequate
    - Renal insufficiency, initial 100mg IV, doubled if necessary
    - 5-10% of body weight should be lost (1-2L or 2lbs initially)
        - Failure again indicates diuretic resistance
            - Add metolazone (2.5-10mg)
            - Continuous infusion to get urine output ≥100cc/hr

    - [Michigan Medicine Inpatient Diuretic Guideline for Patients with Acute Decompensated Heart Failure][2]
- Hypotension
    - IV Vasopressor (norepinephrine)
        - Useful in Pulmonary congestion for rapid dyspnea relief if preserved Blood pressure
    - Low Blood Pressure: Cardiogenic shock
        - Generally, presents with hypoperfusion (reduced urine output)
            - Inotropic Therapy
    - Use in hypotension, endo-organ hypoperfusion, shock
        - Most often due to Acute MI > tamponade, massive PE, acute mitral or aortic regurgitation
    - If due to contractile failure
        - Dobutamine + Norepinephrine to get MAP ≥65 w/ Mechanical circulatory support
            - Intra-aortic Balloon Counter pulsation
