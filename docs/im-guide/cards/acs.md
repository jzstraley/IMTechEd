## Background

- Completely or partially occluding thrombus on a disrupted
    atherothrombotic coronary plaque leading to myocardial
- STEMI: Elevated troponin & elevation in ST segment or new LBBB with
    symptoms
  - \> 0.1 mV in at least 2 contiguous leads
  - Exception, in V2-V3:
    - \> 0.2 mV in men older than 40 y/o
    - \> 0.25 in men younger than 40 y/o
    - \> 0.15 mV in women
- NSTEMI: Evidence of myocardial necrosis (elevated troponin) w/o ST
    segment elevation
- Unstable Angina: Angina without evidence of myocardial necrosis
    (normal troponin)
- Other causes of myocardial injury: coronary spasm, embolism,
    imbalance of oxygen demand and supply 2/2 fever, tachycardia,
    hypo-/hypertension

## Chest Pain/Angina Pectoris

- HEART vs. TIMI vs. GRACE[^2]
- ^^[Diagnosis]^^[3]
  - Update on Stress Testing[^4]
    - {==Not interpretable for ischemia if:==}
        1. Old LBBB
        2. Unable to reach target HR
        3. Baseline ST elevation
        4. Digoxin use
    - Get Stress Testing with Imaging (MPI, CMR, or Echo) if unable to do Exercise Stress Test
      - Indications
          1. Unable to exercise
          2. Baseline EKG abnormalities limiting interpretation
          3. Indeterminate findings on Exercise Stress Test 
        - No adenosine in asthmatics, hypotension (stimulate A2A receptors on vascular smooth muscles, magnified from rest)
    - {==Positive Findings==} (Findings associated with poor outcomes)
      - Poor exercise capacity (<5 METs)
      - Exercise-induced angina during minimal expenditure
      - Inability to achieve 85% age-predicted maximum HR with exercise
      - Fall in SBP below baseline during exercise
      - ST elevation
      - â‰¥ 2mm ST-depression during minimal expenditure
      - Early onset or prolonged duration of ST depression during testing
      - ST depression in multiple leads
      - Ventricular couplets or tachycardia during minimal expenditure or recovery
    - Balanced Ischemia
      - High risk features on Exercise testing
      - Coronary blood low is equally or nearly equally impaired
      - ST depression in multiple leads during peak stress but no evidence of ischemia on radionuclide MPI

## Myocardial Infarction

- [Definition][5]
- Management
  - P2Y12
    - PLATO[^6]: Ticagrelor > Clopidogrel in ACS including mortality
    - DAPT[^7]: Continuing Thienopyridine after 12 months decreased risk of In-stent thrombosis and MI at 18 months, increased risk of bleeding
    - WOEST[^8]: Bleeding w/AC + Plavix < Triple Therapy w/o change in MI/Stroke/MACE
    - COGENT[^9]: PPI with DAPT reduces GIB 87%, no CV event change
  - Statins
    - PROVE-IT[^10]: Significantly reduced CVD events following MI with High-dose Lipitor vs. Pravastatin
  - ACEI
    - SAVE[^11]: ACEI improve survival/morbidity/mortality in LV dysfunction after MI
  - MADIT-II[^12]: ICD improves survival in pts with prior MI and severe LV dysfunction
