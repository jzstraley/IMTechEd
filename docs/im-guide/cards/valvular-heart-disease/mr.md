## Chronic Mitral Regurgitation

* Myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve leaflets and chordae
    * Abnormal accumulation of proteoglycans
* Most common cause in developed countries is MVP
    * Rheumatic HD, Annulus dilation from LV dilation, endocarditis, CAD or MI causing papillary muscle ischemia
* LV systolic dysfunction is MCC of Chronic Secondary MR

## Exam

* Atrial fibrillation is common
* Severe Dyspnea, fatigue, HF due to decreased CO and increased
* Chronic severe MR can cause left atrial dilation which can lead to Afib (palpitations)

## Murmur

* Constant intensity, holosystolic murmur at the apex
    * Radiates to the axilla
* S1 is soft or absent and S2 is widely split
* S3 is common if severe
    * A third heart sound may arise from volume overload, displaced apical impulse
* Mid-systolic clock followed by a mid-late systolic murmur
* Progresses to a severe MR with sole holosystolic murmur w/o a click

## Diagnosis: TTE

* LVEF is often normal or increased
* Increased left ventricular compliance in chronic MR, dilated LA
* Central regurgitation jet in secondary MR, Eccentric in RHD due to leaflet dysfunction
* Stage D or Stage C with:
    * LVEF: <60%
    * Symptoms
    * LV enlargement with LV end systolic diameter ≥40mm
    * PAH with PAP >50mmHg
    * New onset Atrial Fibrillation

## F/U

* Severe + No symptoms: Echo 6-12 months

## Treatment

* [Trends in diagnosis and management][1]
* [Less than severe MR guidelines][2]
* Significant: ACEIs/ARBs and Diuretics (Afterload reducers)
    * +/- Beta blockers
    * Nitroprusside
    * IABP if needed
* Percutaneous Valve Repair > Replacement in Stage C and D
    * Reconstruction: Valve repair +/- annuloplasty with an annuloplasty ring
        * Especially likely to be done with MVP, ruptured chordae, flail leaflets, endocarditis, and annular dilation
    * Mitral Valve reconstruction whenever possible, ½ the morbidity and better outcomes than replacement
        * Replacements need replaced after 15 years, also require lifelong anticoagulation
    * More likely to be done in MR due to Rheumatic fever
* Mitral Clip (TEER)
    * Class 2a recommendation
    * Transcatheter “edge-to-edge” percutaneous MV repair
    * Clip is placed across two leaflets in their mid-part, creating a double orifice mitral valve
    * For severe disease + high surgical risk
* Severe
    * Regurgitant orifice area 0.4cm or greater, regurgitant volume of 60mL or greater or a vena contracta of 0.7cm or greater
    * Primary (Degenerative): mid-systolic click, late mitral regurgitation, and anterior prolapse
        * LVEF >60% + Asymptomatic: Echo q6-12 months
        * LVEF >60% + Asymptomatic + LVESD >40, PASP >50, or New-onset atrial fibrillation: Surgical Repair
        * LVEF >60% + Symptomatic: Surgical Repair >> Replacement when possible
        * LVEF 30-60%: Surgical Repair >> Replacement when possible
* Class 1 indications for Repair: LVEF 30-60% and/or an LV End-systolic diameter of ≥40mm
    * Undergoing other cardiac procedure
* Surgical MV repair unless Class III or IV and high surgical risk: TEER if anatomy is favorable and life expectancy is >1 year
    * Replacement otherwise
        * LVEF <30%: Medical Optimization (surgery on case-by-case basis), typically irreversible damage
    * GDMT as 1st line therapy (reverses remodeling) for Secondary MR (Class I)

## Acute Mitral Regurgitation

* Increased LVEDP, increased LA pressure with acute pulmonary edema and congestive heart failure
* Normal left ventricular compliance, increased LA pressure
* Causes:
    * Native:
        * Flail leaflet (endocarditis, MVP, trauma)
        * Papillary muscle ischemia or rupture (MI, Trauma)
        * Chordae Tendineae rupture (Endocarditis, Acute RF, trauma, spontaneous)
    * Prosthetic:
        * Tissue valve leaflet rupture
        * Mechanical valve closure problem (thrombosis)
        * Paravalvular regurgitation due to infection

## Symptoms

* Acute-onset pulmonary edema
* Blowing decrescendo murmur at the apex with axillary radiation
* Severe Dyspnea

## Murmur Character

* Early decrescendo systolic murmur best heard at the apical impulse/apex

## Diagnosis: TEE

* Hyperactive LV with normal to high ejection fraction and a normal sized LA
* Large left sided V waves on wedge pressure tracing

## Management

* Afterload reduction and diuresis
* Intra-aortic balloon pump may be helpful, unlike in severe AR
* Urgent surgery is often required
    * Other Causes:
        * Mild-Moderate MR: Mitral Annular Calcification, older adults with fibrous annulus degeneration
        * Infective Endocarditis (fever, embolic findings)
