## Etiology

- Narrowing of the aortic valve due to either congenital bicuspid aortic valve or more commonly age-related calcification (fibrocalcific) and degeneration of the valve due to atherosclerosis
    - Have a high rate of CAD: 1/3 in those 40-60 y/o and 2/3 in those >60 y/o
    - [Heyde Syndrome][1]
        - Characterized by the triad of aortic stenosis, GI bleeding from angiodysplasia, and acquired von Willebrand syndrome
        - Etiology
            - Increased circulatory shear forces and its effect on the physiologic confirmation and subsequent cleavage of large vWF multimers
        - Most often seen in men >65
        - Diagnosis: TTE + PFA
            - Confirm PFA w/vWF multimer analysis
        - Complications: GI bleeding
        - Treatment
            - Aortic Valve replacement is virtually curative
- 3 MCC of Aortic Stenosis:
    - <70 y/o: Bicuspid Aortic Valve (between 40-70)
        - Most common congenital Valve disorder (1-2%)
            - [Bicuspid aortic valves in hearts with other congenital heart disease][2]
            - Associated with congenital aortic root dilation (i.e. thoracic aortic aneurysm)
            - [Bicuspid aortic valves are associated with aortic dilatation out of proportion to coexistent valvular lesions][3]
        - Ejection click after S1 may be present, Senile calcific will not have this, may also be seen in PS
        - Management based on predominant valve dysfunction (AR/AS)
            - Aortic Sinuses or ascending aorta ≥4.0cm: Lifelong serial imaging
            - [Clinical characteristics of bicuspid aortic valves in surgical patients][4]
    - RF: Rheumatic Heart Disease
        - Usually in the setting of MV disease
    - ≥70 y/o: Senile Calcific Aortic Stenosis (≥75 usually)
        - 7.5% of persons 75 y/o or older, 1.8% of persons 75 or older have moderate-to-severe AS

## Types

- Supravalvular Aortic Stenosis
    - 2nd Most common type of Aortic Stenosis
    - Usually refers to congenital left ventricular outflow tract obstruction due to discrete or diffuse narrowing of the ascending aorta
        - Systolic murmur as seen with valvular AS, but best heart at the right first intercostal space (higher than valvular AS)
        - +/- unequal carotid pulses, differential blood pressure (high-pressure jet in ascending aorta), and a palpable thrill in the suprasternal notch
    - Develop LVH over time if significant and have coronary artery stenosis as an associated anomaly
        - Increased O2 demand, subendocardial or myocardial ischemia
    - Above aortic valve, LV outflow obstruction, LVH, exertional angina

## Symptoms

- Asymptomatic
    - Severe: 75% die or develop symptoms within 5 years
- Classic Triad: Heart Failure, Angina, and Syncope with Exercise
- Exertional dyspnea, lightheadedness or dizziness with exertion, chest pain, and syncope (late finding), progressive fatigue, and exertional lightheadedness and presyncope

## Exam

- Delayed carotid pulses, slowed upstroke (pulsus parvus et tardus)
    - Indicate severe stenosis but may be absent in older patients
    - Sustained apical impulse

## Murmur

- Mid to late peaking, diamond shaped systolic ejection murmur at RUSB or suprasternal notch that radiates to the neck
    - Typically asymptomatic unless AV area <1cm^2
- Crescendo/decrescendo
    - The later the peak, the more severe the stenosis
    - Mild: Early peaking
    - Severe: Mid-Late peaking, paradoxical S2 split
        - May have Soft S2 if senile calcific
- Soft single S2, delayed A2 on top of P2 = S2
    - A2 soft and delayed
- S4 Gallop
    - Occurs as the result of left atrial kick against a stiff left ventricle if CHF is present due to Aortic Stenosis
- May have systolic thrill over the upper precordium and suprasternal notch
- Often decreased or absent aortic component of the 2nd heart sound due to decreased mobility of the aortic valve leaflets

## Maneuvers

- Louder with squatting, Softer with Valsalva
- Right intercostal space radiating to carotids
    - May be transmitted to the apex instead of the neck (Gallavardin Effect)
- Parvus et parvus/tardus pulse (slow rising/delayed pulse)
    - Usually age dependent, isolated

## Classification

- Severity determined by mean valve Pressure Gradient (PG), peak aortic jet velocity (Vmax), or Aortic Valve Area (AVA)
    - Mild: <25mmHg
    - Moderate: 25-40mmHg
    - Severe:
        - PG: ≥40mmHg or Vmax: ≥4.0m/s
            - HG-AS: AVR recommended
        - AVA: ≤1.0cm^2
            - LG-AS:
                - LF-LG: Reduced LVEF
                - Paradoxical LF-LG: Preserved LVEF w/SV <35
                - NF-LG: index SV ≥35
            - HG-AS: AVR recommended
- Low flow (LVF) gives low pressure and velocity readings, need to determine valve area:
    - Mild: 1.9-1.6cm^2
    - Moderate: 1.5-1.1cm^2
    - Severe: ≤1cm^2
- Low gradient AS (LG-AS)
    - AVA <1cm + Peak jet velocity ≤4.0ms and mean pressure gradient ≤40

## Diagnosis confirmation

- Severe: Doppler Ultrasound (TTE)
    - Discrepancy 2/2 low SV or CAD also:
        - Left Heart Cath or Dobutamine Echo

## Prognosis

- Survival without Surgical Intervention (SASH)
    - Survival in AS:
        - Angina = 5 years
        - Syncope = 3 years
        - Heart Failure = 2 years
    - Worst prognosis of all valvular lesions, medical therapy is not effective, use caution when treating VF with vasodilators if due to AS

## Treatment

- LHC prior to valve surgery in most
    - 40% require CABG as well
    - Retrograde cath across a severely calcified valve increases risk of embolic stroke
        - Perform with caution and only when non-invasive techniques are not enough
        - Consider CCTA instead in young patients
        - [Should we cross the valve: the risk of retrograde catheterization of the left ventricle in patients with aortic stenosis][5]
- [PARTNER-2][7]: No difference in death or disabling stroke at 5 years after TAVR vs. SAVR for patients at intermediate surgical risk
- Mild: TTE q3-5 years
- Moderate: TTE q1-2 years
- Severe Aortic Stenosis
    - TTE every 6-12 months, life expectancy 1-2 years with symptoms
    - Differentiate between pseudo-stenosis and true AS w/dobutamine stress test in low EF
    - Indications for valve replacement
        - Symptoms
        - LV systolic dysfunction EF <50% in an asymptomatic pt
        - Concomitant cardiac procedure (CABG, AA surgery)
- TAVR > SAVR
    - >80 y/o, life expectancy <10 years, OR above
    - Must not have AR
- Symptomatic, Ideal
    - SAVR: Surgical Aortic Valve Replacement
        - All Stage D
        - All Stage C with Severe disease on Testing, LVEF <50% w/symptoms (syncope, angina, dyspnea), or undergoing other cardiac surgery (CABG)
            - Valve treatment prior to elective noncardiac surgeries
    - TAVR: Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement
        - Use in pts with prohibitive risk for SAVR and predicted post-TAVR survival >12m
- Shock/Pulmonary Edema
    - Consider Percutaneous Balloon Aortic Valvulotomy
- Comorbid conditions
    - [Manage concurrent conditions (AFib, CHF, CAD)][6]
