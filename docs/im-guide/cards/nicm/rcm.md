## General

- Aka Restrictive Pericarditis
    - Must differentiate from Constrictive Pericarditis (which is reversible)
- [Infiltrative Cardiomyopathies][6]
- Irreversible, myocardial problem
    - CHF w/LVH and normal ventricular chamber dimensions that may progress to dilated cardiomyopathy or may be thickened with granularity
- Exam
    - Usually has pulmonary congestion
    - S3
    - Pericardial thickness <2mm
- Labs
    - BNP markedly elevated (BNP normal to slightly elevated in Constrictive Pericarditis)
        - >600 typically
- Diagnostics
    - EKG may be normal or low voltage
    - Atrial Fib early
    - PA systolic pressure >60
- Treatment
    - Diuretics
    - Thoracotomy with Pericardiectomy

## 1) Amyloidosis

### Types

- AL (Immunoglobulin Light-chain) Amyloidosis
- ATTR (Transthyretin Amyloid) Amyloidosis
    - More common in men
    - Abnormal 99m-technetium pyrophosphate scan can be used to avoid biopsy to distinguish

### Features

- Cardiac
    - Restrictive cardiomyopathy
        - Concentric ventricle thickening with diffuse fibril deposits
        - [Cardiac amyloidosis: a practical approach to diagnosis and management][1]
    - Conduction defects, low voltage
    - Orthostatic hypotension
- Renal
    - Nephrotic syndrome
    - Peripheral edema
- CNS
    - Peripheral and/or autonomic neuropathy
    - Stroke
- GI
    - Hepatomegaly
    - Dysmotility, malabsorption
    - GI bleeding
- Pulm
    - Pulmonary nodules, tracheobronchial infiltration, pleural effusions
- MSK
    - Enlarged tongue, shoulder pad enlargement
- Skin
    - Thickening of skin, subcutaneous nodules/plaques
    - Ecchymoses, periorbital purpura
- Heme
    - Anemia
    - Thrombocytopenia

### AL Cardiomyopathy

#### Complications

- VT/VF
    - Much more common than in ATTR-CM

### Transthyretin Amyloid Cardiomyopathy (ATTR-CM)

#### Etiology

- 5000-7000 cases annually, male predominance, hATTR is AD
    - 100 different mutations
    - Mc in USA is Val122Ile (3-4% of AA, 1.5m carriers)
    - Mc globally is Val30Met
- Transthyretin amyloid cardiomyopathy is a rare but severe cause of restrictive cardiomyopathy, caused by the accumulation of transthyretin fibrils in the myocardium
    - Synthesized in the liver into 4 Beta-sheet-rich monomers that normally act as a carrier proteins for retinol and thyroxine
    - Misfolded transthyretin aggregates and preferentially deposits in the Myocardium and Peripheral nerves
    - Chromosome 18 carries the TTR protein gene
        - Mutations in gene coding can cause structural changes in TTR causing misfolding
            - Aka hATTR or hereditary ATTR
        - Misfolding due to normal aging is called wATTR or wild-type ATTR (more common)

#### Symptoms

- CHF (fatigue/poor exercise tolerance/SOB)
- Arrhythmia

#### Labs

- 40-50% of ATTR have unrelated Monoclonal Gammopathy

#### Diagnosis

- Gold Standard: Endomyocardial biopsy with congo red staining
    - SN/SP 100% if ≥4 sites sampled
- PYP and CMR
- EKG: Low voltage with poor R wave progression in precordial leads
    - 25-40% of ATTR-CM patients
    - Different than normal LVH people who have large waves*
    - Pseudo-infarct pattern also reported
    - High voltage QRS pattern in Val122Ile possible
    - Abnormal mass/voltage ratio
        - Increased LV mass and low QRS voltage (<5mm in limb leads, <10mm in precordial leads)
            - Compare to strain pattern seen in LVH (increased QRS voltage), pericardial effusion (decreased QRS without LVH)
- TTE: Bi-ventricular hypertrophy
    - Septal wall thickness of >12mm makes it a consideration
    - Increased echogenicity
    - Small LV, Biatrial enlargement, thickened interatrial septum, thickened valves
    - Diastolic dysfunction
- Strain TTE: “Apical sparing” with progressive worsening longitudinal strain when moving to midventricular and basal segment is characteristic
    - “Bulls-eye”, “Cherry on top” pattern
    - Apical to basal strain ratio and apical to mid-ventricular plus basal strain[^1]
- CMR:
    - With late gadolinium enhancement (CMR-LGE)
        - Diffuse late mid-myocardial gadolinium enhancement in a noncoronary distribution
    - The presence of diffuse transmural or subendocardial deposits can diagnose amyloidosis with a sensitivity and specificity of 85 to 90%
    - Inability to "null" or suppress the myocardial signal on phase-sensitive inversion recovery (PSIR) imaging of LGE scan is also diagnostic
    - It is seen that T1 signals are amplified in cardiac amyloidosis, similar to post-contrast extracellular volume fraction (ECV)
    - CMR with parametric imaging can identify native (non-contrast) myocardial T1 signal and ECV
    - [Parametric imaging is believed to be a more sensitive and reliable measure of amyloid burden, and therefore can be used for treatment tracking][4]
- Nuclear Imaging is only diagnostic imaging technique
    - TC-PYP is 100% specific when Grade 2-3 present
        - No need for biopsy
        - Myocardial uptake ≥ Bone
    - Heart to contralateral chest uptake ≥1.5 = ATTR
        - ≥1.6 ratio have worse 5-year outcomes
- Genetic Testing after PYP or Biopsy
    - Differentiates hATTR from wATTR

#### Staging

- [Mayo Clinic wATTR-CM System][5]
    - Stage I: 66 months
    - Stage II: 42 months
    - Stage III: 20 months

#### Complications

- Cardiomyopathy/Diastolic Dysfunction/Heart Failure/LVH
    - TTR found in 20% of HF patients with myocardial wall thickening of more than 14mm
    - More common in wATTR than hATTR
    - Cardiorenal Syndrome typically ensues
    - [Often become BB and ACEI/ARB intolerant][3]
- Peripheral Neuropathy
    - More commonly seen in hATTR than wATTR
    - Bilateral carpal tunnel syndrome
        - 50% of wATTR
        - Occurs 5-10 years before wATTR-CM
    - Lumbar stenosis
        - Spinal foraminal narrowing
- Spontaneous tendon ruptures are not uncommon
    - 33% of wATTR-CM patients had spontaneous rupture of distal biceps tendon
- Autonomic Dysfunction
    - Orthostatic hypotension
    - Erectile Dysfunction
    - Dyshidrosis
    - GI motility issues
    - More common in hATTR than wATTR
        - ACEI/ARB/BBs often poorly tolerated
- Arrhythmias
    - More common in wATTR than hATTR
    - AFIB: 40-60% at time of diagnosis (usually persistent)
        - Often slow or controlled due to concomitant conduction disease
            - Leads to falls, syncope, falls
    - Conduction Disease
    - Ventricular Arrhythmias
        - Less common than in AL-CM
    - 33% require pacemakers eventually
- Thrombosis
    - Irregardless of Afib status

#### Prognosis

- hATTR-CM (2.5 years mean) worse than wATTR-CM (3.5 years mean)
- hATTR w/polyneuropathy w/o CM (8-10 years mean)

#### Management

- CHF: Loops (Bumetanide/Torsemide) for volume
    - Avoid Verapamil
    - Midodrine + Compression stockings
- Afib: Rhythm control to preserve atrial kick
    - Amiodarone preferred
    - Lifelong AC regardless of CHADs-VASc
- Patisiran (Onpattro)/Inotersen (Tegsedi)
    - Block synthesis of mutated TTR proteins by mRNA silencing
    - Both approved for hATTR polyneuropathy w + w/o CM
- Tafamidis (Vyndamax/Vyndaqul)
    - FDA approved for ATTR-CM
    - 1B per ESC
    - [Reduces all-cause mortality and CV hospitalization in CHF I/II but takes 2 years][2]
    - Stabilizes TTR tetramer to prevent tissue deposition
- Diflusinal
    - Not FDA approved
    - Stabilizes TTR tetramer to prevent tissue deposition
        - Doxycycline + Tauroursodeoxycholic Acid
    - Removes deposited amyloid fibrils
