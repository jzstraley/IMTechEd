## General

- Dilated Ventricles with normal wall thickness, depressed myocardial contractility
    - Absence of hypertension or valvular disease
    - AA ~3x more likely to develop
- Left ventricular dysfunction causes progressive HF
    - Arrhythmias, conduction abnormalities, thromboembolism, SCD
    - Symptomatic HF + DCM: 50% 5-year mortality
- Diagnosis: Echocardiography
    - Eccentric LV hypertrophy
    - Dilated ventricles with diffuse hypokinesia, low EF, CHF

### A) Idiopathic (MC)

- Viral Myocarditis (Infectious):
    - Coxsackie B
    - Chagas
    - HIV

### B) Familial

### C) Metabolic

- Thiamine Deficiency, Obesity, DM, hyperthyroidism

### D) Alcoholic Cardiomyopathy (Toxic)

- CHF w/heavy alcohol consumption, macrocytic anemia, no CAD
    - History (>5-10) years of excessive (>7 drinks/day) of consumption
- Treatment: Alcohol abstinence

### F) Hemochromatosis (Dilated > Restrictive): Can be reversed with phlebotomy

- Late hemochromatosis

### G) Other

- Acromegaly, Cocaine
- Cancer chemo (doxorubicin, daunorubicin) - Anthracyclines
- Ephedra, Cobalt, Anabolic steroids, Chloroquine, Clozapine, Amphetamines, Methylphenidate, Catecholamines, Tachycardia, Organic Solvents (glue snifferâ€™s heart)
