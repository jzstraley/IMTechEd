## General

- 33% improve, 33% remain the same, 33% LV function deteriorates

### [Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy][1]

- Normal coronaries
- Chest pain, sudden onset with ECG showing ST elevations
- Apical ballooning with akinesis

### [Peripartum Cardiomyopathy (PPCM)][2]

- RF: >30 y/o, Multiparity, AA, Multiple fetuses, Maternal cocaine use, Terbutaline (beta-agonist) use >4 weeks
- Uncommon cause of Dilated Cardiomyopathy
- Occurs anytime from week 26 through first 6 months postpartum
- Progressive dyspnea on exertion, lower extremity edema, 3rd heart sound is suggestive of decompensated HF
- Often associated with mitral regurgitation (holosystolic murmur)
- Cardiomegaly, prominent vascular congestion, pleural effusions
- Symptoms
    - Heart failure, Dyspnea, cough, orthopnea, and peripheral edema
    - Onset of HF during last month of pregnancy or within 5 months following delivery (not seen before 36 weeks)
    - LV systolic dysfunction with LV ejection fraction <45%
    - Absence of causes of heart failure
    - Absence of heart disease prior to final month of pregnancy
- Diagnosis: TTE
- Prognosis
    - [LVEF >30% at time of diagnosis is major predictor of persistent LV dysfunction][5]
- Treatment
    - Same as HF unless Advanced HF or Unstable (delivery)
        - Not ACEI/ARBs
        - Loops > thiazides (fetal bleeding diathesis)
        - B1 selective
        - Avoid Digoxin

### [Tachycardia-Induced Cardiomyopathy][3]

- Commonly due to Afib caused by structural changes in the heart
    - May also be due to atrial flutter, MAT, reentrant SVT, VT, and rarely frequent PVCs
    -[Afib induced LV dysfunction][4]
- Cardiomyopathy due to LV dilatation and dysfunction
- Symptoms
    - Palpitations
    - Progressive dyspnea, exercise intolerance, fatigue
- Exam
    - HR â‰¥120 for weeks/months
    - Can lead to myocardial cellular changes, LV dilation, impaired LV function
- Diagnosis: ECG or Ambulatory Holter
- W/U: TTE, testing to R/O MI
- Complications
    - Decompensated Heart Failure
- Treatment
    - Rate or rhythm control
        - Typically results in significant or complete LV function recovery over a period of months
