### General

- Also called Hypertrophic Obstructive Cardiomyopathy (HOCM)
- HCM is preferred as some patients with HCM have no obstruction
- Asymmetric hypertrophy of the left ventricle as compared to the rest of the heart and includes notable thickening of the Interventricular septum
    - Disordered myocytes, small vessel disease, replacement scarring, interstitial fibrosis
        - Definition: LV wall thickness ≥15mm at any location in the absence of other potential causes (HTN/VHD)
- 100% genetic Causes (Autosomal Dominant)
    - Variable expressivity/penetrance
    - Sarcomere Protein Gene Mutation (MC)
        - Defect in energy transfer from mitochondria to sarcomere and or direct dysfunction
            - Reduced SV due to impaired diastolic filling
        - B-myosin heavy chain MC > myosin binding protein C
    - Hypercontraction heart
        - Massive Myocardial hypertrophy w/o dilatation
            - Myofiber disarray
        - Disproportionate thickening of the ventricular septum > left ventricular free wall
            - Most prominent subaortic region
        - Abnormality: Systolic anterior motion of mitral valve, moves toward IV septum

### Symptoms

- May be asymptomatic or patient may have family with heart attack
    - Young athlete with a murmur, signs or symptoms or heart disease
    - MCC of SCD <35 (36%)
- HF, fatigue, chest pain, palpitations, syncope, asymptomatic
- Occasional lightheadedness and vague chest discomfort when playing sports or with strenuous activity (Systolic Ejection murmur exacerbated by dehydration/impaired LV filling)

### Murmur

- Mitral Regurgitation
- LVOT Obstruction
    - Left sternal border without carotid radiation
    - Harsh systolic Crescendo/decrescendo ejection murmur
        - Worse with dehydration/impaired LV filling
        - Hypertrophy causes a 4th heart sound
        - Progression to HF causes a 3rd heart sound
    - Louder with Valsalva (decreased preload), Softer with squatting/hand grip (increased preload)
    - Carotid pulse with brisk upstroke (bifid in 2/3)

### Diagnosis

- Confirmation: Transthoracic Echocardiography
    - [2011 ACCF/AHA guidelines for diagnosis][3]
- ECG: LVH + depolarization/repolarization abnormalities
    - Abnormal in >90%
    - Prominent Q waves
        - Inferior and lateral indicating septal depolarization
    - T-wave inversions
- TTE: LVH, increased LVOT gradient, SAM of mitral valve
    - Focal septal hypertrophy present
    - LV diastolic function impaired
    - LV cavity size decreased
    - Enlarged LA
- Exercise testing and family screening

### Complications

- Afib
    - 20-25% develop afib
    - Increased stroke risk
    - Need to be treated with warfarin (CHADSVASC is not useful here)
        - Only one studied
- SCD
    - 1% per year
    - RF for SCD:
        - FH of SCD in 1st degree relative
        - History of Cardiac Arrest (or sustained spontaneous VT)
        - Personal history of syncope suspected to be arrhythmic in nature
        - Non-sustained VT on Holter
        - Failure to augment SBP on ETT (<10 increase at peak exercise)
        - Septal thickness ≥30mm in any segment
        - EF <50%
    - [Risk stratification][1]
- Heart Failure

### Prognosis

- Most have normal life expectancy, no symptoms

### [Management][2]

- [Should not participate in high-intensity competitive sports regardless of symptoms, LVOT, or prior treatment][4]
- Symptomatic
    - 1) Non-vasodilating Beta-Blockers, ensure adequate hydration if symptomatic
        - Not Carvedilol, Labetalol
        - Metoprolol should be ok
        - BBs only in patients with symptoms
        - Prolong diastole and decrease contractility, decreasing LVOT
            - Can be used in obstructive and non-obstructive
        - IV phenylephrine if acute hypotension and no fluid response
    - 2) CCBs additionally in pts with persistent symptoms
        - Verapamil, Obstructive only
        - Avoid Amlodipine/ACEI, Diuretics
    - 3) Add Disopyramide
- ICD placement
    - Wall thickness >30mm
    - HCM + Arrest or sustained VT (Class I recommendation)
    - Syncope
    - Blunted BP or hypotension during exercise
    - RF above you can offer (Class IIa recommendation)
    - Indicated for primary and secondary prevention of SCD in patients with ≥1 major high-risk features
- Septal reduction therapy (SRT)
    - Septal myectomy or Alcohol septal ablation
    - Peak LV outflow (resting or Valsalva gradient) of ≥50 mmHg and drug refractory HF/Symptoms
    - Surgery if persistent/ascending aorta (septal myectomy if HF III/IV, transcatheter ethanol injection to reduce LVOT symptoms)
