## Stress Testing

* Update on Stress Testing[^1]
* Exercise Treadmill Test
    * [Pooled data][1]
        * Men: Sensitivity of 68% and Specificity of 77% for CAD
        * Women: Sensitivity of 61% and Specificity of 70% for CAD
    * {==Not interpretable for ischemia if:==}
        1. Old LBBB
        2. Unable to reach target HR
        3. Baseline ST elevation
        4. Digoxin use
    * Note:
        * Resting ST-segment depression <1mm increases test sensitivity but decreases specificity with no change in overall accuracy
        * Role less clear in RBBB
* Get Stress Testing with Imaging (MPI, CMR, or Echo) aka Pharmacologic Stress Testing or "Lexiscan" if unable to do Exercise Stress Test
    * Indications:
        * Unable to exercise
        * Baseline EKG abnormalities limiting interpretation
            * LBBB, RBBB
        * Indeterminate findings on Exercise Stress Test
    * Notes
        * No adenosine in asthmatics, hypotension (stimulate A2A receptors on vascular smooth muscles, magnified from rest)
    * {==Positive Findings==}
        * 1mm of horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression
        * 2mm of upsloping ST-segment depression
    * Findings associated with poor outcomes
        * Poor exercise capacity (<5 METs)
            * Patients achieving ≥10 METs have a 0.1%/year rate of cardiac death and 0.7%/year rate of nonfatal MI
        * Exercise-induced angina during minimal expenditure
        * Inability to achieve 85% age-predicted maximum HR with exercise
            * Calculated as (220 - Age)
        * Fall in SBP below baseline during exercise
        * ST elevation
        * ≥ 2mm ST-depression during minimal expenditure
            * Maximum ST-segment deviation is a strong predictor of both cardiac death and composite cardiac death and nonfatal MI
        * Early onset or prolonged duration of ST depression during testing
            * Rapid recovery is associated with a low rate of positive imaging or findings of CAD on angiography
        * ST depression in multiple leads
        * Ventricular couplets or tachycardia during minimal expenditure or recovery

## Balanced Ischemia

* High risk features on Exercise testing
    * Coronary blood low is equally or nearly equally impaired
    * ST depression in multiple leads during peak stress but no evidence of ischemia on radionuclide MPI
