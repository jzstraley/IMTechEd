- General
  - Degrade thrombi
  - Systemic administration: Acute MI, Acute Ischemic stroke, most Massive PE
  - Catheter based: Peripheral arterial thrombi, proximal deep veins
  - Drugs
    - All convert plasminogen to plasmin (zymogen to enzyme)
      - Degrades fibrin matrix
    - rtPA, alteplase
      - fibrin specific, plasminogen bound, activated (converts to plasmin)
      - higher fibrin affinity, works better around clots
      - \<75 w/\<6h of symptoms of Acute MI, Iv for 1-1.5h
    - Nonspecific – fibrin bound and circulating plasminogen activation – plasmin can cause lytic state
      - Streptokinase – no fibrin affinity
        - IV for Acute MI – reduce mortality
          - hypotension
      - Urokinase – not immunogenic, catheter lysis of thrombi
