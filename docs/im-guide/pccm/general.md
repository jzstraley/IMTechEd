* ACLS
    * General
        * Capnography (measurement of partial pressure of CO2 in the exhales breath over time)
* End-tidal CO2
    * Typically gradually rises with high-quality CPR
        * Increase in CO w/ROSC will show a sudden rise in EtCO2 on capnography (Ex. 16 to 38) and is the earliest indicator of ROSC, even before a pulse is palpated
        * EtCO2 of ≤10 mmHg after 20 minutes of CPR are highly unlikely to achieve ROSC
* Anemia
    * [IRONMAN][1]: IV Iron not better than placebo did not change RBC transfusion during stay
* Illness Severity Assessment
    * qSOFA
    * APACHE IV

## ICU-Acquired Weakness 
    * Medical Research Council Muscle Scale (MRCMS) is a bedside tool used to evaluate weakness 
    * Critical Illness Myopathy
        * RF: Steroids, Neuromuscular blocking agents, Sepsis
        * Features
            * Flaccid limbs
            * Facial and respiratory weakness
            * Normal sensation
        * Normal to mild CK elevation (<2000)
    * Critical Illness Polyneuropathy
        * RF: Sepsis
        * Features
            * Flaccid limbs
            * Respiratory weakness
            * Distal sensory loss
        * Normal CK
    * Rhabdomyolysis
        * RF: Infection, Medications, Serotonin Syndrome, Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome
        * Features
            * Mild to moderate limb weakness
            * Muscle swelling
            * Myalgias
            * DTRs intact
        * Marked CK elevation (>5000)
    * Guillain-Barre Syndrome
        * RF: infection
        * Features
            * Progressive and symmetric
        * Normal CK
    * Prolonged Neuromuscular Blockade
        * RF: Prolonged paralytic agent use (days), often in renal or hepatic insufficiency
        * Features
            * Flaccid limbs
            * Respiratory weakness
            * Transient improvement after anticholinesterase
        * Normal CK

## Hypothermia
    * Symptoms
        * Shivering, but as hypothermia progresses, shivering stops
        * Moderate: Bradycardia, hypoventilation, lethargy, atrial arrythmias, decreased shivering
        * Severe: absent reflexes, ventricular arrhythmia, asystole, and apnea
    * Diagnosis: Temperature
        * Monitoring: Esophageal temperature probe
            * Rectal and bladder temperatures will lag the rising core temperature during the rewarming process.
    * Treatment
        * Mild (> 35.0 °C (95.0 °F))
            * Passive external warming
        * Moderate (28.0 - 35.0 °C (82.4 - 95.0 °F)) or (<28.0 °C (82.4 °F)) w/o coma or CV collapse
            * 1) Active external warming
                * Warming blankets and forced warm air, heating pads
            * 2) Active internal warming
        * Severe (<28.0 °C (82.4 °F)) in the setting of coma or cardiovascular collapse
            * Cardiac Arrest: Extracorporeal support, including cardiopulmonary bypass, VA ECMO
            * No Cardiac Arrest: Active internal rewarming (107F fluid)
                * Infusion of heated intravenous crystalloid solution as well as lavage of the peritoneal or pleural cavities irrigation
        * Other (Acid-Base Disturbances): HD

## Heat Stroke
    * Strenuous activity during hot and humid weather
        * Dehydration, poor acclimatization, lack of fitness
    * Hyperthermia
    * Core temp >104F (40C) immediately after collapse plus:
        * CNS dysfunction: AMS, confusion, irritability, seizure
        * Additional organ failure: DIC, Renal/Hepatic failure, ARDS
    * Monitoring
        * Rectal or esophageal probes
    * Prognosis:
        * 20-60% mortality
    * Treatment
        * Fluid resuscitation, electrolyte correction
        * No antipyretic therapy
        * Exertional: Ice water immersion
        * Non-Exertional: Evaporative cooling (lukewarm water with fans), high-flow cool water dousing, ice/wet towel rotation, cold shower
            * Ice Water immersion has increased mortality in elderly w/Non-Exertional Heat Stroke
