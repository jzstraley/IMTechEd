## Perioperative Risk Assessment

1) Stabilize acutely active cardiac disease prior to non-emergent non-cardiac surgery
    * General
        * Increase risk, require further evaluation before non-emergent non-cardiac surgery
            * Unstable Angina or recent MI
            * Decompensated HF
            * Significant Arrhythmia (Symptomatic bradycardia, high grade AV block, SVT, New or recent onset VT)
            * Severe Valvular Disease (Severe AS, Symptomatic MS)
2) Assess Procedural Risk
    * Pts undergoing low risk surgeries have <1% risk of MACE
        * No further cardiac workup is needed regardless of underlying comorbidities
    * 1) Cardiac Risk of Non-cardiac Surgical Procedures
        * Risk of cardiac death, nonfatal cardiac arrest, nonfatal MI
        * Low-Risk
            * Breast (lumpectomy, mastectomy)
            * Skin Surgery
            * Simple Dental Work
            * Endoscopic Procedure
            * Cataract Extraction
        * Intermediate-Risk
            * Head and Neck (Thyroidectomy)
            * Orthopedic (Knee Arthroplasty)
            * Prostate
        * High-Risk
            * Aortic or other major vascular
            * Intrathoracic
            * Open Intraperitoneal
    * 2) Cardiac Risk Stratification
        * Revised Cardiac Risk Index (RCRI)
            * Predictors of major cardiac complications with noncardiac surgery
            * 6 Risk Predictors
                * High-risk surgery (vascular)
                * History of IHD
                * History of CHF
                * History of Stroke or TIA
                * T2DM w/Insulin
                * Pre-op Creatinine >2
                * Rate of Cardiac Death, nonfatal cardiac arrest, or nonfatal MI
                    * No RF: 0.4% (low risk)
                    * 1 RF: 1.0% (low risk)
                    * 2 RF: 2.4% (moderate risk)
                    * ≥3 RF: 5.4% (high risk)
            * RCRI ≤1% (low risk) can proceed directly to surgery
                * Otherwise assess functional status
    * 3) Assess Functional Status
        * If able to achieve ≥4 METS, generally do not require additional evaluation
        * MET = volume of O2 consumed at rest (3.5mL O2 uptake/kg/min)
            * <4 METs:
                * Eat, dress, use toilet
                * Walk indoors in the house
                * Do light work (Vacuuming)
            * ≥4 METs
                * Climb a flight of stairs
                * Run a short Distance
                * Do yardwork (Raking leaves)
                * Participate in golf, tennis, or dancing
        * Otherwise needs cardiac eval w/TTE or Preop Stress Testing
