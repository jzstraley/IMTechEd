- General
    - MCly due to lack of water access or excess insensible losses
        - Hypervolemic Hypernatremia
            - Iatrogenic
            - Exogenous Glucocorticoids/Cushings
            - Primary Hyperaldosteronism
        - Euvolemic Hypernatremia
            - Diabetes Insipidus
                - Nephrogenic vs. Central
        - Hypovolemic Hypernatremia
            - Renal Losses
                - Diuresis
                - Renal failure
            - Extrarenal losses
                - Typically diarrhea
- Symptoms
    - Progressive as hypernatremia worsens:
        - Restlessness or muscle weakness
        - Insominia
        - Lethargy
        - AMS
        - Coma
- Management
    - 1) Calculate free-water deficit ([MdCalc][1]): ((Na-140)/140) x TBW
            - Estimate TBW: 50% of body weight in women, 60% men
    - 2) Administer deficit over 48-72h, without decrease in plasma Na+ concentration by >10mM/24h
            - A fast rate of correction (>10-12 mEq/day) has not been shown to be associated with worse outcomes [30948456][2]
    - 3) Account for Ongoing Water Losses
        - Calculate free-water clearance (FWC):
            - FWC = V x (1 – (UNa + Uk)/PNa) where V is urinary volume, UNa is urinary Na+, Uk is urinary K+, and PNa is plasma Na+
    - 4) Insensible Losses ~10 ml/kg per day; less if ventilated, more if febrile
    - 5) Add above components and correct the water deficit over 48-72h replace daily water loss

- Treatment
    - Oral water if tolerating PO intake
    - If not tolerating oral intake:
        - Free water flushes via NG tube (400-600ml boluses q4-6hrs)
        - IV Dextrose in water (D2.5W or D5W)
        - If Hypovolemic: 
            - 0.9% saline(isotonic) until euvolemic, then 5% dextrose (hypotonic) or 0.45% saline (hypotonic)
    - DI: D5W is used
    - Acidotic (diarrhea): Na+HCO3- is a 5% dextrose solution or may use LR<br>
