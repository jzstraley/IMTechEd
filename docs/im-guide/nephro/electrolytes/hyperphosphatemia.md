-	Definition: Phosphate >4.5mg/dL (1.45 mmol/L)
-	Causes
    -	Decreased Renal Excretion (MC)
        -	Acute < Chronic Kidney Disease
        -	Hypoparathyroidism
    -	Transcellular Shift from ICF to ECF
        -	Rhabdomyolysis
        -	Tumor Lysis Syndrome
        -	Massive Hemolysis
        -	Metabolic Acidosis
        -	Insulin Deficiency (DKA) > Lactic Acidosis
        -	Fulminant Hepatitis
        -	Severe Hyperthermia
    -	Increased Intake
        -	Vitamin D analog use
        -	Bisphosphonates
        -	Fosphenytoin
        -	Phospho-soda Enemas (Fleet)
    -	Pseudo
        -	Hyperbilirubinemia
        -	Hyperlipidemia
        -	Hemodialysis
        -	Hemolyzed sample
        -	Liposomal Amphotericin B
        -	Paraproteinemia (multiple myeloma)
    -	Increased Reabsorption
        -	Tumoral Calcinosis (FGF23 defect)
-	Symptoms
    -	Asymptomatic
        -	Related to hypocalcemia
        -	Binds calcium and precipitates it in the tissue
    -	Metastatic calcifications may occur
        -	Painful nodules, calcification of soft tissues, pruritis
    -	Calciphylaxis
-	Complications
    -	Renal Osteodystrophy
    -	Phosphate nephropathy
-	W/U: Calcium-Phosphate Product
    -	Predicts risk of calciphylaxis (>70 causes a risk of calciphylaxis)
-	Treatment
    -	Should correct within 12-24hr if normal kidney function
    -	Acute
        -	Phosphate restricted diet
        -	Stop VitD
        -	Increase Renal Excretion
        -	Normal Saline (IVF) and Acetazolamide +/- Lasix
        -	Hemodialysis
            -	Increase frequency or duration
    -	Renal Failure
        -	Phosphate restricted diet + oral phosphate binders
        -	Sevelamer (Renagel)
            -	800mg TID w/meals, double dose PRN
            -	Check med interactions (may absorb some drugs)
            -	Preferable in dialysis, avoids mg/ca problems
        -	Calcium acetate (PhosLo)
            -	667mg (two tablets TID w/meals)
            -	Pts with significant hypocalcemia and Ca-phos product <70
            -	Avoid in hypercalcemia, product >66, vitD intoxication
        -	Lanthanum
        -	Calcium carbonate
