## GFR
* How to measure renal function in clinical practice
    * https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17023465/ 
* Serum creatinine and serum cystatin C are the primary biomarkers used to estimate GFR
    * Nonlinear relationship
        * Every time GFR halves, the serum creatinine doubles
    * PCT meds that decrease creatinine excretion: 
        * Cimetidine, Trimethoprim, Cobicistat, Dolutegravir, Bictegravir, Rilpivirine
* Non-progressive rise in serum creatinine (0.2-0.3 mg/dL)
    * More pronounced in CKD
* Do not affect GFR
* Do not need to stop unless (hematuria, pyuria, proteinuria increase)
* Could measure Cystatin C
    * Cystatin C less affected by age, sex, muscle mass
* BUN
    * Affected by protein intake and catabolic rate
    * Increases with glucocorticoids, hemorrhage, or trauma

## False Creatinine Elevations
* Increased Production (0.5-1.0)
    * Menstrual and Diurnal variations, race, and diet (meat)
    * Intense Exercise
    * Increased meat intake or Creatine Supplements
    * Fenofibrates (8-18% change), Rhabdomyolysis
    * Corticosteroids (10%)
* Interference
    * Antibiotics (Cephalosporins especially cefoxitin and cefazolin)
    * Barbiturates, N-acetylcysteine, chemo drugs (Flucytosine)
    * Dopamine (-)
    * Ketone bodies
* Decreased Tubular Secretion (15%)
    * Trimethoprim, Cimetidine, H2 blockers, Ranitidine
    * Pyrimethamine, Salicylates, Cobicistat, Calcitriol
        * Does not affect eGFR

## Indications for Kidney Biopsy
* Glomerular hematuria
* Severely Increased Albuminuria
* Acute on chronic kidney disease
* Kidney Transplant dysfunction or monitoring
