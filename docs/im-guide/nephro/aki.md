* Aka Acute Renal Failure (ARF)
    * Acute, severe decrease in renal function
    * Hallmark is azotemia (increased bun and Cr), often with oliguria
    * [Guidelines][1]
* Definition and Staging (KDIGO 2012)
    * Azotemia: elevation of BUN and Creatinine with a decrease in GFR
    * 3 Types: Prerenal, Intrarenal, Postrenal
        * 80% recover completely, MCC of mortality is infection
        * Up to 75% of deaths are from infection, 2<sup>nd</sup> mcc is cardiorespiratory
    * AKI is defined as any of the following:
        * Increase in serum Cr by ≥0.3mg/dl within 48hr
        * Increase in serum Cr to ≥1.5xbaseline (50%) within 7 days
        * Urine Volume <0.5 ml/kg/h for 6 hours (oliguria)
    * Acute Kidney Disease (AKD)
        * Definition: AKI or GFR &lt;60 for <3 months or GFR decrease by &gt;.35% or increase in SCr by 50% for 3 months
* Symptoms
  * May be Oliguric, Anuric, or Nonoliguric
  * MC weight gain and edema (+ H2O and Na+ balance)
  * Fatigue, Anorexia, Nausea, Oliguria, Hematuria, Flank pain, AMS
* Staging
  * Stage 1: Cr 1.5-1.9xbaseline or ≥0.3 increase, UOP <0.5ml/kg/h for 6-12h
  * Stage 2: Cr 2.0-2.9xbaseline, UOP<0.5 for ≥12hours
  * Stage 3: Cr 3.0xbaseline for Cr≥4.0 or dialysis
    * UOP <0.3 for ≥24h or anuria for ≥12h
* Proteinuria Urine Dipstick (Albumin)
  * Trace: 15-30 mg/dL
  * 1+ protein: 30-100 mg/dL
  * 2+ protein: 100-300 mg/dL
  * 3+ protein: 300-1000 mg/dL
  * 4+ protein: >1000 mg/dL
* Diagnosis
    * Rule out prerenal failure (BUN:Cr, UNa, FeNa)
    * Rule out postrenal w/sonogram (KUB US)
        * May also be negative in postrenal
    * Get U/A
    * If negative
        * Biopsy
* Testing
  * [Finding the cause of acute kidney injury: which index of fractional excretion is better?][2]
  * Dipstick UA for blood, protein, WBC, nitrites, glucose
  * [Uric Acid as a Prognostic factor for in-hospital mortality in AKI][6]
  * Consider Acute Nephritis and consult when a pt with AKI and no cause has urine dipstick showing protein or blood in the absence of UTI, menses, or trauma due to catheterization
* Imaging
  * Obtain US if AKI unknown
    * If pylonephrosis: get immediate US (within 6 hours)
      * Kidney size, hydronephrosis, hydroureter
    * Without cause of AKI: get urgent US (within 24 hours)
  * Obtain CT scan if Nephrolithiasis is suspected
  * Renal Arteriography if Renal Artery Occlusion is suspected
  * Renal Biopsy
    * Glomerulonephritis or AIN
* Complications: Hypervolemia, Hyperkalemia, Metabolic Acidosis, Uremia, Infection
  * Can cause non-anion or anion gap Metabolic Acidosis
    * Non-Anion Gap: Excretion Impaired, ammonia, bicarb reabsorption
    * Anion Gap: Retention in Uremia
  * Acute Renal Failure (ARF)
    * Azotemia, volume retention, and weight gain
* Treatment:
  * Unless in shock, use isotonic crystalloids rather than colloids for volume expansion to correct fluid imbalance
  * Correct electrolyte imbalance
  * Refer for immediate Dialysis if AKI is not responding to medical management plus: hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, uremic symptoms, fluid overload, pulmonary edema

    * [IDEAL-ICU: AKI w/Sepsis in the ICU; No difference in mortality][7]
        * [NEJM][9]
    * [AKIKI: Early vs. Late in Severe AKI in the ICU; No difference in mortality][8]
  * [Consider sodium bicarb if acidotic and mild AKI][4]
  * Anemia
    * [No consequence of IV Iron to treat anemia][5]
  * Right jugular > Femoral vein for access with un-cuffed non-tunneled cath
