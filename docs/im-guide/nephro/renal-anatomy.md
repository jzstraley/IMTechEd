* Horseshoe Kidney
    * Usually found antenatally, asymptomatically
        * 90% fused at the inferior pole
        * 10% at superior pole
        * Become trapped under the IMA around L3
* May compress ureters
* Kidney function usually normal
    * Postnatal ultrasound to evaluate for possible hydronephrosis
        * +/- Abdominal and Pelvic CT (with and without contrast)
        * Serum Cr and GFR
    * Increased risk for kidney stones and complicated pyelonephritis
    * Greater risk to worsening kidney function
    * Increased risk of malignancies (Wilms Tumor)
    * Consider Turnerâ€™s Syndrome (50%-60% have horseshoe kidneys)
    * Routine F/U and Close Surveillance
* Renal Agenesis
    * Absent Kidney formation, may be unilateral or bilateral
    * Potter Sequence
        * Bilateral Agenesis leading to oligohydramnios with lung hypoplasia, flat face with low set ears, and developmental defects of the extremities
* Dysplastic Kidney
    * Non-inherited congenital malformation of the renal parenchyma characterized by cysts and abnormal tissue (cartilage)
    * Usually unilateral, may be bilateral
