## General

- 33% improve, 33% remain the same, 33% LV function deteriorates

### Myocardial Infarction with Nonobstructive Coronary Arteries (MINOCA)

- [Defined as acute myocardial infarction (MI) with angiographically no obstructive coronary artery disease or stenosis ≤ 50%][7]
- CMR: Edema in coronary regional distribution pattern
    - Late gadolinium enhancement

### Takotsubo Cardiomyopathy (TTS)

- [Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: state-of-the-art review][1]
- [Update of Takotsubo cardiomyopathy: Present experience and outlook for the future][6]
- Etiology
    - Primary
        - Idiopathic
        - Psych Stress
    - Secondary
        - Physical Stress
            - Asthma, Surgery, Severe Trauma
        - Drug-Induced
            - Catecholamine Stimulation (68.2% of drug-induced TTS cases)
                - Antiarrhythmics (Flecainide, Sotalol, Amiodarone, Lidocaine, Xylocaine)
            - Antidepressants
            - Chemotherapy (8.9%)
- Symptoms
    - Chest pain, sudden onset
- Labs
    - Troponin elevation mimicking acute MI
    - Check CRP/ESR
    - Check TSH/BNP
    - Consider r/o pheochromocytoma
- Diagnosis
    - ECG showing ST elevations
    - TTE: Apical ballooning with akinesis
    - LHC: Normal coronaries, needed to r/o CAD
    - CMR if no culprit lesion (gold-standard for determining myocardial status)
        - LV dysfunction in a noncoronary regional distribution pattern w/ + w/o RV involvement
        - Edema in NCRDP
        - Abscence of significant necrosis or fibrosis
        - Lack of any late gadolinium enhancement
    - InterTAK Diagnostic Score
        - >70 is high probability
    - Recovery of wMA on CMR within 2-6 months
        - Confirms Diagnosis
- Treatment
    - ACEI + BBs

### [Peripartum Cardiomyopathy (PPCM)][2]

- RF: >30 y/o, Multiparity, AA, Multiple fetuses, Maternal cocaine use, Terbutaline (beta-agonist) use >4 weeks
- Uncommon cause of Dilated Cardiomyopathy
- Occurs anytime from week 26 through first 6 months postpartum
- Progressive dyspnea on exertion, lower extremity edema, 3rd heart sound is suggestive of decompensated HF
- Often associated with mitral regurgitation (holosystolic murmur)
- Cardiomegaly, prominent vascular congestion, pleural effusions
- Symptoms
    - Heart failure, Dyspnea, cough, orthopnea, and peripheral edema
    - Onset of HF during last month of pregnancy or within 5 months following delivery (not seen before 36 weeks)
    - LV systolic dysfunction with LV ejection fraction <45%
    - Absence of causes of heart failure
    - Absence of heart disease prior to final month of pregnancy
- Diagnosis: TTE
- Prognosis
    - [LVEF >30% at time of diagnosis is major predictor of persistent LV dysfunction][5]
- Treatment
    - Same as HF unless Advanced HF or Unstable (delivery)
        - Not ACEI/ARBs
        - Loops > thiazides (fetal bleeding diathesis)
        - B1 selective
        - Avoid Digoxin

### [Tachycardia-Induced Cardiomyopathy][3]

- Commonly due to Afib caused by structural changes in the heart
    - May also be due to atrial flutter, MAT, reentrant SVT, VT, and rarely frequent PVCs
    -[Afib induced LV dysfunction][4]
- Cardiomyopathy due to LV dilatation and dysfunction
- Symptoms
    - Palpitations
    - Progressive dyspnea, exercise intolerance, fatigue
- Exam
    - HR ≥120 for weeks/months
    - Can lead to myocardial cellular changes, LV dilation, impaired LV function
- Diagnosis: ECG or Ambulatory Holter
- W/U: TTE, testing to R/O MI
- Complications
    - Decompensated Heart Failure
- Treatment
    - Rate or rhythm control
        - Typically results in significant or complete LV function recovery over a period of months
