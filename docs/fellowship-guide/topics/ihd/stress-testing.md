## Stress Testing

- Update on Stress Testing[^1]
- Exercise Treadmill Test
    - [Pooled data][1]
        - Men: Sensitivity of 68% and Specificity of 77% for CAD
        - Women: Sensitivity of 61% and Specificity of 70% for CAD
    - {==Not interpretable for ischemia if:==}
        - Old LBBB
        - Unable to reach target HR
        - Baseline ST elevation
        - Digoxin use
    - Note:
        - Resting ST-segment depression <1mm increases test sensitivity but decreases specificity with no change in overall accuracy
        - Role less clear in RBBB
- Get Stress Testing with Imaging (MPI, CMR, or Echo) aka Pharmacologic Stress Testing or "Lexiscan" if unable to do Exercise Stress Test
    - Indications:
        - Unable to exercise
        - Baseline EKG abnormalities limiting interpretation
            - LBBB, RBBB
        - Indeterminate findings on Exercise Stress Test
    - Notes
        - No adenosine in asthmatics, hypotension (stimulate A2A receptors on vascular smooth muscles, magnified from rest)
    - {==Positive Findings==}
        - more than 1mm of horizontal or downsloping ST-segment depression 8 ms after the J-point during exercise or recovery
        - more than 1.5-2mm of upsloping ST-segment depression 8 ms after the J-point during exercise or recovery
    - Findings associated with poor outcomes
        - Poor exercise capacity (<5 METs)
            - Patients achieving ≥10 METs have a 0.1%/year rate of cardiac death and 0.7%/year rate of nonfatal MI
        - Exercise-induced angina during minimal expenditure
        - Inability to achieve 85% age-predicted maximum HR with exercise
            - Calculated as (220 - Age)
        - Fall in SBP below baseline during exercise
        - ST elevation
        - ≥ 2mm ST-depression during minimal expenditure
            - Maximum ST-segment deviation is a strong predictor of both cardiac death and composite cardiac death and nonfatal MI
        - Early onset or prolonged duration of ST depression during testing
            - Rapid recovery is associated with a low rate of positive imaging or findings of CAD on angiography
        - ST depression in multiple leads
        - Ventricular couplets or tachycardia during minimal expenditure or recovery

### LOW-RISK STRESS FINDINGS (associated with a cardiac mortality of less than 1% per year)

- 1. Low risk treadmill score (score ≥ 5)
- 2. Normal or small myocardial perfusion defect at rest or with stress
- 3. Normal stress echocardiographic wall motion or no change of limited resting wall motion abnormalities during stress

### INTERMEDIATE-RISK STRESS FINDINGS (associated with a 1-3% per year cardiac mortality)

- 1. Mild/moderate resting left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF 35-49%)
- 2. Intermediate risk treadmill score (-11 score to < 5)
- 3. Stress-induced moderate perfusion defect without LV dilation or increased lung intake (thallium-201)

### HIGH-RISK STRESS FINDINGS (associated with a >3% per year cardiac mortality)

- 1. Severe resting left ventricular dysfunction (LVEF < 35%)
- 2. High-risk treadmill score (score ≤ -11)
- 3. Severe exercise left ventricular dysfunction (exercise LVEF < 35%)
- 4. Stress-induced large perfusion defect (particularly if anterior)
- 5. Stress-induced multiple perfusion defects of moderate size.
- 6. Large, fixed perfusion defect with LV dilation or increased lung uptake (Thallium-201)
- 7. Stress-induced moderate perfusion defect with LV dilation or increased lung uptake (thallium-201)

## Balanced Ischemia

- High risk features on Exercise testing
    - Coronary blood low is equally or nearly equally impaired
    - ST depression in multiple leads during peak stress but no evidence of ischemia on radionuclide MPI
