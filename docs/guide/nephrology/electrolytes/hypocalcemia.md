-	General
    -	Serum total Calcium < 8.5 or ionized <1.1
        -	Ionized: <0.8 warrants treatment, <0.65 is critically low
    -	Corrected serum calcium is calculated by adding 0.8mg/dl x difference below the reference of 4.1 g/dl in albumin
        -	Pseudohypocalcemia
            -	Total Calcium is reduced due to decreased albumin but ionized calcium is normal
-	Causes
    -	Hypoparathyroidism (MCC)
        -	Autoimmune Disease
        -	Malignant or infectious infiltrate (hemochromatosis or Wilson disease)
        -	Thyroidectomy
        -	DiGeorge Syndrome
        -	CaSR gene defect
    -	Thyroid Surgery (hypoparathyroidism), acute pancreatitis, sepsis, tumor lysis syndrome, Acute Alkalosis (increase in albumin binding calcium), Chelation (blood (citrate) transfusion, EDTA, Calcium binding Meds (Foscarnet, Citrate, Fluoroquinolones))
        -	High Volume blood transfusion (citrate)
            -	Hepatic or renal failure at greatest risk
    -	CRRT, Leukapheresis, Plasmapheresis, Massive Transfusion
    -	Ethylene Glycol poisoning
    -	Magnesium abnormality (especially hypomagnesemia)
    -	Impaired 1,25-VitD production with Hyperphosphatemia from CKD
        -	MCC of acquired hypocalcemia
    -	Rhabdomyolysis/Tumor Lysis increase binding of phos and calcium
        -	Low ionized calcium
    -	Prostate/Breast Cancer
    -	Anticonvulsants (Phenytoin, Phenobarbital, Carbamazepine)
        -	INH, rifampin, pentamidine, aminoglycosides
        -	Loops
        -	Bisphosphonates, calcitonin, cisplatin, 5-FU
        -	Cinacalcet
-	Symptoms
    -	Moderate:
        -	Peri-oral tingling, paresthesia, Tetany
        -	Hyperreflexia
        -	Muscle weakness, cramping, myalgias, fasiculations
        -	Chvostek Sign (facial spasm by tapping near the patient’s facial nerve)
        -	Trousseau Sign (carpopedal spasm when a sphygomometer is tightened on the arm for more than 3 minutes)
    -	Severe: Seizures, laryngospasm, confusion, bradycardia, decompensated HF
        -	Prodrome may be absent prior to death
        -	Hypotension, Heart block
        -	QT prolongation
            -	Slower influx means it takes longer for intracellular calcium to reach the threshold to close L-type Ca2+ channels, extending AP duration, extending QT
-	Diagnosis: Remeasure and measure albumin for corrected calcium level < ionized calcium
    -	Magnesium and Phosphate
    -	Calcidiol (25-Hydroxy VitD) and Calcitriol (1,25-Hydroxy VitD)
        -	Low 25-Hydroxy VitD indicated VitD deficiency
        -	Low 1,25-Hydroxy VitD indicate renal failure, hypoparathyroidism
    -	Lipase
    -	CK if K+ and phos are elevated
    -	Measure PTH
        -	Hypocalcemia + Low/Normal PTH: Hypoparathyroidism
        -	Hypocalcemia + Elevated PTH: Renal Failure, VitD deficiency, PTH resistance, intravascular chelation
-	Treatment
    -	1) Symptoms
        -	Tetany, carpopedal spams, laryngospasm, long QT, seizures, arrythmias
    -	2) QT prolongation without hypokalemia or hypomagnesemia
    -	3) Severe Hypocalcemia (iCa2+ < 0.8)
    -	Don’t treat:
        -	Mild-moderate pts who are critically ill
        -	Hyperphosphatemia: increases precipitation of calcium phosphate (calciphylaxis)
        -	Ethylene glycol poisoning: calcium oxalate in the brain
    -	Ca2+ ≥7.5 g/dl: 
        -	1) Oral Calcium Carbonate 1-3g q6hr-q12hr > Calcium Citrate > Calcium Gluconate
        -	2) Calcitriol (1,25-Dihydroxyvitamin D) 1000-4000IU per day
    -	Ca2+ <7.5 g/dl or severe: 
        -	1) IV Calcium Gluconate 2-3g peripheral > Calcium Chloride 1g Central
            -	Over 10-20 minutes, may need to repeat (slow via central IV)
            -	SE: Nausea, vomiting, hypertension, flushing, chest pain
            -	Pancreatitis/still falling: 1g Calcium gluconate over 60 minutes, q1hr prn
    -	Monitor for hypercalciuria (limits therapy)
        -	Add thiazide
            -	Teriparatide 20 nanograms BID rapidly eliminates hypocalcemia in acute post-surgical patients
            -	Dialysis vs binders may be preferred if Severe Hyperphosphatemia
            -	100-200mg over 10-20mins (bolus) + slow infusion of 0.5-1 up to 2 mg/kg/hr as 10% calcium gluconate until Ca at 8-9
        -	Chronic: VitD supplementation (50k weekly)
